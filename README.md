# PrivateGPT
PrivateGPT is a production-ready AI project that allows you to ask questions to your documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in scenarios without an Internet connection. 
100% private, no data leaves your execution environment at any point.

TBD: update this content to include the new API approach.

The first version of PrivateGPT was launched in May 2023 with the main goal of using LLMs in a complete offline way by leveraging existing technologies like [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [LlamaCpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) and [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/).
