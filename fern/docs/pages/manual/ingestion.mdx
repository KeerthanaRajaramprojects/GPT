## Ingesting & Managing Documents

The ingestion of documents can be done in different ways:

* Using the `/ingest` API
* Using the Gradio UI
* Using the Bulk Local Ingestion functionality (check next section)

### Bulk Local Ingestion

When you are running PrivateGPT in a fully local setup, you can ingest a complete folder for convenience (containing
pdf, text files, etc.)
and optionally watch changes on it with the command:

```bash
make ingest /path/to/folder -- --watch
```

To log the processed and failed files to an additional file, use:

```bash
make ingest /path/to/folder -- --watch --log-file /path/to/log/file.log
```

After ingestion is complete, you should be able to chat with your documents
by navigating to http://localhost:8001 and using the option `Query documents`,
or using the completions / chat API.

### Reset Local documents database

When running in a local setup, you can remove all ingested documents by simply
deleting all contents of `local_data` folder (except .gitignore).

To simplify this process, you can use the command:
```bash
make wipe
```

## Supported file formats

privateGPT by default supports all the file formats that contains clear text (for example, `.txt` files, `.html`, etc.).
However, these text based file formats as only considered as text files, and are not pre-processed in any other way.

It also supports the following file formats:
* `.hwp`
* `.pdf`
* `.docx`
* `.pptx`
* `.ppt`
* `.pptm`
* `.jpg`
* `.png`
* `.jpeg`
* `.mp3`
* `.mp4`
* `.csv`
* `.epub`
* `.md`
* `.mbox`
* `.ipynb`
* `.json`

**Please note the following nuance**: while `privateGPT` supports these file formats, it **might** require additional
dependencies to be installed in your python's virtual environment.
For example, if you try to ingest `.epub` files, `privateGPT` might fail to do it, and will instead display an
explanatory error asking you to download the necessary dependencies to install this file format.


**Other file formats might work**, but they will be considered as plain text
files (in other words, they will be ingested as `.txt` files).
