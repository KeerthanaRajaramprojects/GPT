## MySQL Configuration
Text-to-SQL querying has been tested for [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) in PrivateGPT.

To use the text to SQL feature, set the following environment variables to allow connecting to your MySQL Server:

```yaml
sqldatabase:
  dialect: mysql
  driver: pymysql
  host: <db_hostname_here>
  user: <db_username_here>
  password: <db_password_here>
  database: <database_name_here>
  tables: <list_of_table_names_here>
```

You will also need to install `pymysql`.

`poetry add pymysql`

## Other Databases
To get started with exploring the use of other databases, set the `sqldatabase.dialect` and `sqldatabase.driver` properties in the `settings.yaml` file.

```yaml
sqldatabase:
  dialect: <dialect_here>
  driver: <driver_here>
```

Refer to [SQLAlchemy Engine Configuration](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) for constructing the DB connection string.
