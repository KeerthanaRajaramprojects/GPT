**I. Introduction and Executive Summary** 

Dermal concerns relating to the use of the brain-computer interface wearable headset include comorbid conditions affecting the skin on the head where the headset and electrodes will be directly in contact. Dermal conditions affecting areas other than points of contact between the headset and head do not warrant clinical consideration. A condition can result in exclusion if it includes irritation at or around the area of contact with the headset or electrodes as well as immediate or eventual discomfort from the headset or electrodes. Altered bodily reactivity to a component of the wearable caused by an allergen causing exaggerated reaction do necessitate clinical consideration. An allergy can result in exclusion if the allergen is contained in the headset and results in a substantial reaction affecting the patient externally or internally.

***1a. Myasthenia Gravis*** 

Myasthenia Gravis patients are often affected by comorbid dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disorder linked to muscle weakness and rash. These rashes may be avoided with proper skin care and treatment of the locked-in patient. If severe enough and located in a point of contact with the headset, dermatomyositis warrants clinical consideration.

***1b. Locked-In Syndrome*** 

Locked-In Syndrome is not known to be associated with any dermal comorbidities.

***1c. Huntington’s Disease*** 

Huntington’s Disease is associated with several comorbid dermal conditions including hyperkeratosis, thickening of the outer layer of skin, epidermal atrophy, the microscopic degeneration of connective tissue, and subepidermal fibrosis, a tumor-like nodule that can cause severe itching and pain. Huntington’s Disease patients in stages 4 and 5 are known to experience skin breakdown. These comorbidities are not likely to warrant exclusion except in severe cases located on the head, however patients with these conditions should be clinically evaluated. A final condition of Huntington’s that may be associated with the skin is tingling phantom sensations, similar to shivering. Although patients may feel as if this tingling is due to a dermal condition, phantom sensations are in fact purely mental and therefore do not qualify as a dermal exclusion factor.

***1d. Rett Syndrome*** 

Although not directly linked to the skin, patients with Rett Syndrome are subject to vasomotor instability or “hot flashes” in which the patient has a sensation of heat in the body that can cause discomfort. Hypersensitive skin and delayed sensitivity to pain contribute to increased incidence of skin injury which does not pose an issue with the proper monitoring and care, but still increases risk of damaging the skin in contact with a wearable. Skin breakdown and ulcers are also present especially in cases with insufficient skincare or a sedentary patient.

***1e. Spinal Cord Injuries*** 

A relatively small number of patients with Spinal Cord Injuries present with Seborrheic dermatitis, an eczema that affects the scalp, which may require immediate resolution before headset use due to the nature and location of the itchy rash. Pressure sores are common with paralyzed patients due to immobility but should not affect headset use unless the neck and head are completely paralyzed.

***1f. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy*** 

Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are at high risk of skin conditions. Rashes burns, skin breakdown and pressure injuries all present at higher rates. With proper self-care and diet, patients can reduce the risk of skin issues, but patients with DMD should be closely monitored.

***1g. Multiple System Atrophy*** 

Patients with Multiple System Atrophy have similar risk as other degenerative muscle disorders such as increased incidence of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers and other related conditions. MSA is not specifically linked to additional dermal comorbidities.

***1h. Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2 (Dubowitz)*** 

Patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2 have similar risk as other degenerative muscle disorders such as increased incidence of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers and other related conditions. SMA Type 2 is not specifically linked to additional dermal comorbidities.

***1i. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)*** 

Immobility in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis can cause Decubitus Ulcers, however these will most likely not pose an issue for headset compatibility since the ulcers will only be located on nonfunctional parts of the body (generally not the head). ALS patients are also affected by skin breakdown in flexor creases which should not affect qualification because flexor creases are located on the hands, not points of contact with the headset.

***1j. Multiple Sclerosis (MS)*** 

Similar to Huntington’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis can cause phantom sensations or tingling feeling that can be painful or itchy. MS can cause dry and uncomfortable skin that may be in contact with the headset, however this can be combated with cream and wipes to increase comfort. There is literature suggesting an association between Multiple Sclerosis and Bullous Pemphigoid, a rare skin condition causing large fluid filled blisters. Generally, these blisters are located on the lower body, but it is possible they appear in an area on contact with the headset.

***1k. Cerebral Palsy (CP)*** 

People with Cerebral Palsy are especially susceptible to skin conditions such as infections like ringworms and staph infections, irritations and ulcers which can be located on a point of contact with the headset. Some infections such as Impetigo are generally located on the head or face and therefore have a higher risk of contact with the headset.

**II. Dermal Conclusions** 

Dermal affects or injuries at the area of contact with the headset or electrodes can be excluded depending on severity until resolved. Dermal conditions or abnormalities present on the body not located around the area of contact should prompt evaluation with a physician to determine the risk of spreading to the area of contact with the headset. If no visible conditions are present patients should be questioned about dermal history, especially disorder-specific comorbidities. If the patient has a history, a physician should be consulted. If the patient has no history, proceeding without a physician is acceptable if the patient is informed of potential risks and dermal signals that should prompt them to contact a physician and reevaluate headset compatibility.

**III. Final Dermal Notes** 

This deep dive specifically discusses disorder-specific comorbidities, there are a plethora of additional conditions that can be present in conjunction with any patient. The standard for dermal concerns must be patient to patient evaluation, involving physicians when a history is present, to offer no room for error regarding potentially harmful conditions. In order to follow this standard of patient to patient evaluation, in the case of a dermal condition that is present and would normally result in exclusion, exceptions can be made. The brain-computer interface headset has the potential to unlock communication for its users and some patients may be willing to endure slight dermal discomfort to gain that ability. Ultimately the decision is up to the discretion of the user and the physician to determine severity of risk and whether device use is worth potential negative effects.

**IV. Allergies** 

***4a. Nickel*** 

Nickel directly touching human skin can result in contact dermatitis which can cause severe itching, scaly, raw, or thickened skin, dry, discolored, or rough skin, warm, tender skin and fluid-filled blisters. Nickel allergies can develop with prolonged exposure over time, making individuals with prolonged, direct contact with a headset especially susceptible. Literature suggests up to 1 in 5 individuals possess nickel allergies and repeated exposure increases odds of hypersensitivity. Nickel allergies are significantly more prevalent in women which may be due to prolonged contact with nickel-containing substances such as jewelry. The symptoms associated with a nickel allergy would most likely result in exclusion, and nickel was therefore avoided in the composition of the wearable headset.

***4b. Gold*** 

Similar to nickel, gold in contact with human skin can result in contact dermatitis which can cause swelling, rashes, redness, itching, peeling, dark spots and blistering. Literature suggests around 1 in 10 individuals possess nickel allergies and repeated exposure increases odds of hypersensitivity. Gold allergies are significantly more prevalent in women which may be due to prolonged contact with gold-containing substances such as jewelry. Nickel allergies can often be mistaken for gold allergies as impure gold often contains traces of nickel. Gold allergies, similar to nickel and many other metals, can develop with prolonged exposure over time, making individuals with prolonged, direct contact with a headset especially susceptible.

There is no cure for metal allergies however some prescription creams can reduce irritation. Metal allergies are not fatal; however, they can cause severe discomfort. The symptoms associated with a gold allergy would most likely result in exclusion, and gold was therefore avoided in the composition of the wearable headset.

***4c. Latex*** 

Latex allergies can trigger reactions due to contact or inhalation of latex particles and can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Mild symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, itching, skin redness, hives and rashes. More severe symptoms include itchy or watery eyes, scratchy throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing. Life threatening symptoms associated with anaphylaxis include nausea and vomiting, drop in blood pressure, dizziness, loss of consciousness, confusion, rapid or weak pulse and severe difficulty breathing or coughing. Reactions can increase in severity with repeated exposure to latex. This is called sensitization. Several disorders are tied to increased chance of latex allergy, the most prevalent being Spina Bifida. Literature suggests less than 1% of the population has latex allergies, but increased exposure can increase chances of contact dermatitis. The inclusion of latex in the wearable may cause issues regardless of preexisting latex hypersensitivity as sensitization could induce contact dermatitis with the prolonged contact expected of users. For this reason, and the severity of reactions to latex, it has been excluded from the composition of the wearable.

***4d. 3-D Printing Polymers – Polylactic Acid (PLA)*** 

Although there is some discussion regarding potential allergens contained in 3D printed materials, literature regarding hypersensitivity to 3D printed polymers is limited. Polylactic acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) are the two primary concerns as they are the most frequently used in the highest concentration, however no reports of confirmed hypersensitivity have surfaced yet. Concerns that those allergic to corn may also be allergic to the compound extracted from it, PLA, are mistaken as the process of deriving starch from corn removes the allergen. Other potential reactions to microscopic quantities of 3D polymers may be addressed case by case with a physician present, however if any cases are present, nothing suggests the effects to be more than mild.

***4e. Silver*** 

Pure silver in not hypoallergenic, however even sterling silver can contain up to 7.5% other metals. If this metal is nickel, an allergy can appear to come from the silver but come from the nickel through contact dermatitis. Allergies to silver itself are negligible or nonexistent. Although hypersensitivity and allergies are not caused by the silver, prolonged contact can cause argyria, the permanent discoloration of the skin to a bluish-grey color. Localized Argyria can stem from direct contact to silver or silver-containing compounds. Argyria is normally induced through the ingestion of silver soluble liquids, however it is possible through direct contact. Although possible, the chances of argyria vastly decrease when the concentration of silver is diminished within a compound. The guideline set by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) for silver concentration is 0.1mg/m^3 for an 8hr Time Weighted Average (TWA).

***4f. Silver-Chloride*** 

It is possible for silver-chloride to cause skin irritation with prolonged contact of high enough concentration, however the concentration of silver and silver-chloride in the electrodes used in the wearable is nontoxic and should not result in any allergic reaction. In the very low probability that a patient has an adverse reaction to the compounds in the electrodes, it would be minimal and easily addressable with prescription creams or excluded before any serious health risks if the reaction is severe enough. The concentration of silver used in the electrodes is below the guideline mandated by the ACGIH.

**V. Allergy Conclusions:** 

Use of Gold and Nickel in the electrodes and latex in the headset would create due to the high rates of allergy and potential to induce an allergy with prolonged exposure. 3D polymers seem to have no measurable allergic issues. The current working model using electrodes of silver-chloride provide no allergic concerns as the compounds are hypoallergenic. If the concentration of silver remains below the legally safe limit, argyria should not be an issue. The current working model has no issues with allergens, however if this model shifts, new materials must be considered for allergens since possible substitute materials do have major allergen concerns. There is no research directly tying increased odds of allergies to diseases or disorders however it is worth noting managing the allergies may be difficult to manage in conjunction with behavioral or physical conditions.
