Behavioral Considerations

The goal of any Augmentative and Alternative Communication technology is to improve the quality of life of the user and the user's family and caretakers. If a patient is unable to understand that the headset is helping them, they unfortunately must be excluded as any AAC intervention may do more harm than good. Another behavioral consideration is the monetary cost of an uncontrolled behavioral incident resulting in the destruction of the device. Due to the costly and fragile nature of BCI technology, repeated outbursts breaking the device may exclude certain patients. Finally, if the patient understands the device is helping them and is not at risk of breaking the device, but has a behavioral issue preventing them from feeling comfortable with the device on in augmented reality, the patient will be excluded.

Glossary of Behavioral Concerns:

- Depression - The persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest that characterizes major depression can lead to a range of behavioral and physical symptoms.
- Anxiety - A mental health disorder characterized by feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear that are strong enough to interfere with one's daily activities
- Aphasia - loss of ability to understand or express speech, caused by brain damage.
- Amnesia - a partial or total loss of memory.
- Dementia - a chronic or persistent disorder of the mental processes caused by brain disease or injury and marked by memory disorders, personality changes, and impaired reasoning.
- Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) - a disorder marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development.
- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) - a personality disorder characterized by excessive orderliness, perfectionism, attention to details, and a need for control in relating to others.
- Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) - Inappropriate involuntary laughing and crying due to a nervous system disorder.

**Myasthenia Gravis**

Myasthenia Gravis is commonly associated with several mental health disorders that may affect behavior. The highest incidence mental comorbidity being depression, the headset should help users, and depression provides no monetary risk. Depression therefore requires no additional clinical consideration. The greater disqualifying issues associated with Myasthenia Gravis are anxiety and panic attacks. Since panic attacks are usually associated with elevated levels of stress or discomfort, the foreign environment of augmented reality has the potential to trigger an incident of panic or anxiety that could damage the patient or device. This risk warrants the presence of a medical professional at primary fittings of the device.

**Locked-In Syndrome**

The lack of literature discussing specifics of low incidence disorders such as Locked-In Syndrome makes any stipulation nothing more than assumption, however similar disorders allow clinicians to predict expected conditions. The full mental capacity but complete lack of physical ability associated with LIS can be expected to cause mental illness such as depression and anxiety. Despite the potential presence of mental comorbidities, patients with LIS will not be excluded due to these conditions since LIS patients present with normal mental capacity, and their paralysis prevents any possible destruction of the device.

**Huntington’s Disease**

Huntington’s Disease is characterized by several psychiatric comorbidities of ranging severity that can affect behavior. The conditions most discussed in medical literature are depression and anxiety, which lead to significantly increased rates of suicide. Although these conditions are medically serious and can lead to outbursts of anger or apathy, extra clinical consideration for headset compatibility is not necessary since the headset will increase the patient’s quality of life. An exception to this is extreme anxiety in which the patient is unable to maintain normal functions or have repeated and regular panic attacks. Patients with Huntington’s Disease are also affected by less documented comorbidities that affect mood and personality often making the patients more irritable and even angry than a typical person. The cognitive aspect of Huntington’s presents similar to Alzheimer's with aphasia, amnesia and dementia presenting at increasing rates as the disease progresses. These cognitive inhibitions require clinical review as they are associated with mental deterioration which may nullify the benefits of any assistive technology due to a lack of understanding. Aphasia specifically may require a headset variant.

**Rett Syndrome**

Rett Syndrome is often characterized by unusual physical behaviors such as hand-flapping, walking on toes and breath holding, as well as potentially decreased mental capacity, autistic-like behaviors and cognitive disabilities. None of these disorders are remotely exclusive unless extremely severe. Extra clinical consideration is most likely unnecessary unless specific behavioral issues are reported.

**Spinal Cord Injuries (Quadriplegia)**

The full mental capacity but complete lack of physical ability associated with SCIs can be expected to cause mental illness such as depression and anxiety. Despite the potential presence of mental comorbidities such as these, patients with SCIs will not be excluded due to these conditions since SCI patients present with normal mental capacity, and their paralysis prevents any possible destruction of the device.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy usually present with no mental health issues, but they are still possible and people with DMD have increased risk of behavioral issues associated with Autism, ADHD, OCD, social interactions, cognitive impairment and aggression. Although all conditions should be clinically considered, aggression and anger management should take primary concern as it is not necessarily disqualifying but can be if severe enough.

Multiple System Atrophy

Multiple System Atrophy, similar to other Parkinsonian diseases, presents a significantly higher than average rate of dementia as well as increased chance of cognitive impairment and progressive intellectual deterioration. MSA patients require special clinical consideration and care as a window of prime candidacy will exist for most patients, but mental deterioration and dementia may progress to a point of disqualification as the disease progresses.

SMA Type 2 Dubowitz

Spinal Muscular Atrophy does not affect cognitive function or cause intellectual ability; however, it does present a higher than average rate of internalized psychiatric comorbidities, like depression. Surprisingly, SMA is associated with a lower than average rate of externalized psychiatric comorbidities. Since this is the case, additional clinical behavioral consideration is unnecessary.

ALS

Although Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is not generally characterized by mental or behavioral affects, around half of all patients with ALS will experience some of these traits. The behavioral affects are wide ranging from as minor as slight changes in manners, language and decision-making to as major as dementia. Most patients with ALS will not experience affects great enough to come close to warranting disqualification, however in some extreme cases when dementia is present, exclusion is warranted.

MS

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis present with a high likelihood for behavioral changes of some sort. These conditions are wide ranging from mood changes, irritability and increased chance for inappropriate behavior to depression or anxiety. Another less common affect is the Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA), which causes the affected individual to laugh or cry uncontrollably. Multiple Sclerosis is not generally associated with dementia and any behavioral changes are usually minor. For this reason, patients with Multiple Sclerosis do not need additional clinical consideration of behavioral concerns.

CP

Children with Cerebral Palsy are more likely than the average unaffected child to display behavioral comorbidities. These behavioral issues can include anger issues, temper tantrums and social discomfort. Adults with Cerebral Palsy do not seem to exhibit anger issues; however, they are at increased chance of mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. Clinical involvement is not necessary in adults unless extreme anxiety is present, but children with CP and anger issues may warrant increased clinical care and consideration.

Conclusion:

Behavioral abnormalities in headset candidates pose potential issues and disqualifying factors depending on the nature and severity of the comorbidity or condition. Although no behavioral condition is immediately disqualifying, some are at higher for exclusion as they are generally more severe, such as dementia. The vast majority of behavioral or mental conditions in patients are depression and anxiety, which do not seem to be disqualifying. Most other concerns are minor and should be considered, but do not warrant exclusion. In conclusion, very few patients will be excluded for behavioral concerns unless the patient is: uncomfortable in the headset, a danger to breaking the headset or do not understand the benefit of the headset and do not want to wear it.
