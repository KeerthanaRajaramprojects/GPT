# But wait - that's exactly the kind of stimulus we need for our BCI application.

Notes: Yes, it is. But, a few things:

* As mentioned above, only 3% of individuals with epilepsy are triggered by SSVPs, so that's a relatively small group - and one we can define pretty precisely.

* There is also a great deal of variability among "ideopathic" photosensitive epilepsy - for one thing, many age out of the experience in their late 20s; for another, there are some experimental treatments. For example, in 1980 doctors on the US operated to correct nystagmus on a pair of identical twins, one of whom had photosensitive epilepsy and the other did not; after the surgery, neither of them did.

* Photosensitivity appears to be an uncommon feature rather than a hallmark of a specific type of epilepsy; juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has repeatedly been found to have twelve to eighteen times the comorbidity with psychiatric disorders (a separate tragedy, of course), and the presence of photosensitive seizures has proven an important diagnostic measure after traumatic brain injury.

* Finally, outside of contrast and other factors listed above, frequency - measured in Hz - is a major factor both in photosensitive epilepsy and in SSVEPs, which is something we can control for within reason. Where we cannot control for it we simply will be unable to serve a portion of the population, a fact that is tragic but minuscule in impact.
