# Chronofencing

Definition: Online alerts based on the context provided by time. For example, the linked-in page of someone you are interviewing in 15 minutes is suggested to you. Chronofencing provides alerts not of events, but potentially beneficial ads or suggestions from the context of timing of other events you had planned or actions you are completing.
