# Frequency

Definition: Frequencies refer to periodic waves, measured in hertz, or cycles per second. Frequency is directly proportional to pitch with high frequency waves sounding higher pitch and low frequency waves sounding lower pitch. Frequencies can also refer to flashes of light which can be important in the causation of epileptic seizures.
