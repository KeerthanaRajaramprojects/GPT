**Welcome to Addressable Populations,** a comprehensive overview of the lived experience and specific needs of the intended users of our in-development headset pairing brain-computer interface (BCI) with augmented reality (AR).

This interactive resource is designed to serve as a reference to the special considerations necessary to design a wearable communication and control device for individuals with complex medical conditions.

    <aside>
    üëâ *This version of Addressable Populations uniquely focuses on the target constituents for the CXN ONE. It is focused on human factors, UI/UX, and project-specific market sizing, and it is not intended as a comprehensive clinical or technical resource.  For further technical information, contact [Andreas](mailto:andreas@cognixion.com); for further clinical information and requests for expanded data, contact [Luke](mailto:luke@oneimpossiblething.org).*
    
    </aside>
    
    The source material that underpins the information provided here is the product of years of research and clinical practice, and in raw form is considerably more complex. If you find that any aspect of the guidance provided here is inadequate, or if you have any clarifying questions or requests, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:luke@oneimpossiblething.org) and I am more than happy to assist. 
    
    Not everyone needs or wants the same level of detail from this resource, so the wiki structure is intended to make it as easy as possible to hop in and get what you need without getting mired in unnecessary details.
    
    - Industrial Design, Software Engineering, U/X staff and partners: The most important part of this resource for you will be the [detailed summary of acceptance criterion](Acceptance%20Criterion%20Human%20Factors%20and%20Clinical%20Us%201f1f61c15c8e4778bbfa8fb6a503a7d5.md).
    - For medical professionals and their supporters who are aiding in the identification of test candidates for human factors research, the document above is still relevant but the most important will be the clinical deep dives and [reference tables](Quick%20Reference%20Table%20Target%20Populations%20and%20Key%20C%2019161fbad68b40ab8be1ad16fd87f2c6.md).
    - Finally, for electrical specifications and other engineering concerns not related to our population and special human factors, please [contact Andreas](mailto:andreas@cognixion.com) if you do not already have access.
    
    Please [pass along any feedback you would like;](mailto:luke@lukesteuber.com) this is a living resource that will undergo constant stages of improvement based on stakeholder needs, so let me know where it does and doesn't provide what you're looking for and I'll reinforce useful content or redirect as needed.
