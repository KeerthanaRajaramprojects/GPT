# Ideopathic

Notes: A condition with no known biological origin; in recent years when we find something ideopathic with a uniquely identifiable genetic sequence we call that a "de novo" (brand new) mutation. So SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is genetically de novo, pathologic in its transmission, pathophysiological in its impact on cytokenes, and remains ideopathic in certain symptom manifestations.
