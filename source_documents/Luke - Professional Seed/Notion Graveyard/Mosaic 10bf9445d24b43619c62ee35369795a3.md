# Mosaic

Definition: In medicine, when a person has cells with different chromosomal compositions. For example, individuals with mosaic trisomy 21 (mosaic Down syndrome) have some cells without the abnormal duplication of chromosome 21, and some with the duplication. This results in a less severe condition than non-mosaic trisomy 21 since some cells are normal.
