# So again ... what triggers that 3%?

Notes: Research has consistently found the following:

* Television screens with flickering/rolling images, particularly under 20hz.
* Video games and other programming that rapidly flash alternating color patterns.
* Intense strobe lights like the ones we put in every American school for fire drills.
* Static or moving visual patterns that include stripes of contrasting colors.
* There is no conclusive evidence that emergency vehicle lights are a trigger, but many individuals with epilepsy avoid them anyway.

As above, we also consistently know some factors that can either help or hurt the situation:

* Frequency is a predictor, with faster in this case being better. One study found a subject who experienced photosensitive epilepsy with stimulus as low as 2hz, but a good rule of thumb is to avoid 5 to 30 flashes per second.
* Brightness is a factor (bright = worse).
* High contrast with background colors and lighting is a trigger.
* Distance between the viewer and the source is helpful.
* Certain wavelengths of light are particularly problematic (more on that later).
* It might seem obvious but ... whether a person's eyes are open or closed.
