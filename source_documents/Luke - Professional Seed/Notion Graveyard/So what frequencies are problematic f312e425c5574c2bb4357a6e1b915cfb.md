# So what frequencies are problematic?

Notes: That's complicated.

* The most prominent oscillation in the spontaneous EEG exists in a frequency band of 8–12 Hz (alpha band of frequencies) and have multiple cognitive correlates but for the vast majority are "safe"

* The range between 13 and 30 Hz (originally β, beta) is most frequently associated with typical photosensive epilepsy

* For 30-80Hz (γ, gamma); photosensitive seizures occurring at that amplitude tend to have comorbidies of specifically ADHD, Schizophrenia, and Alzheimers, where they have been observed to demonstrate the perceptual distortions usually associated with complex focal seizures. However, one study in the U.K. discovered an individual triggered to seize while playing video games under 50hz.

* It should be noted that EMG activity is found >40 Hz, so there is a higher risk for EMG artifacts (especially if we're looking at signals close to the neck) if we look at gamma band

* Waves from 0-4Hz (δ, delta) and 4-8hz (θ, theta) ranges have been shown to pose dangers to a very small group of individuals, but evidence indicates the frequency may have been less a factor than the contrast or other factors in the stimulus.

* The Omega (ω) range of 80-120Hz has not been found to have any causative effect in epilepsy, but is also not of interest for SSVEP-based BCI - although we have known for fifty years that EEGs can detect oscillations up to 600Hz.

Some research indicates that these oscillations as they interact with brain waves can create "phase synchrony," a kind of harmonics that can be either facilitating - like toasting a glass - or destructive, like dropping the glass. For some reason, those with photosensitive epilepsy seem prone to induced harmonics at certain wavelengths that either focally or generally impact their cognitive and motor functioning. This is consistent with the findings of recent FMRI studies focused on gamma oscillations.
