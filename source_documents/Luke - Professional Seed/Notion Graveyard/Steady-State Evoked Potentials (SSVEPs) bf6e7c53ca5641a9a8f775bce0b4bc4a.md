# Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs)

Notes: As opposed to just a visual evoked potential (VEP), which does not have as long-lasting an effect on a user's distinctive brain signal, steady-state evoked potentials flash at a consistent rate - picture waves crashing on a shore, but in this case the waves are peaks and troughs in the signal coming from your occipital nerve. Because the signal generated by each SSVEP is measurably different, we can use electroencephalography (EEG - literally translated to "zap brain to map it") and - given the right signal to noise ratio, which is where good hardware and algorithms come in - infer their thoughts across a theoretically infinite number of axes if we had no constraints with finances or cranial real estate.
