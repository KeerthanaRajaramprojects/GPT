**Deep Dive: Structural and Orthopedic Comorbidities** 

**I. Introduction and Executive Summary** 

Craniofacial abnormalities may need to be addressed by adjustable features on the AR headset. Extreme physical barriers may warrant exclusion, but the headset has an adjustable format and can therefore overcome minor abnormalities. Structural and Orthopedic Comorbidities located somewhere other than the head that do not affect head or neck positioning do not need to be considered for exclusion as they will not affect device usage. Some conditions such as scoliosis do not affect the head directly but still warrant special consideration as they can impair neck and head positioning and control.

***1a. Myasthenia Gravis*** 

Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular disease, is generally characterized by muscle weakness in the trunk, neck and limbs. This weakness can make it difficult for patients to raise the head and make intentional controlled movements. Patients with Myasthenia Gravis will most likely struggle to effectively use any speech-generating device operated with head-wand pointing. This makes patients with MG ideal candidates for brain-computer interface communication devices or eye-tracking as the devices require little to no intentional head movements. Neck braces are a clinical option for structural support to prevent drooping of the head that could potentially interfere with AAC devices. There is some literature detailing the relatively rare scoliosis comorbidity which requires clinical evaluation and is detailed further below.

***1b. Locked-In Syndrome*** 

Locked-In Syndrome is characterized by tetraplegia or total immobility making any controlled head movements virtually impossible. Even during recovery, trunk and neck strength are they last to recover due to axial hypotonia. This immobility makes patients with Locked-In Syndrome ideal candidates for devices operating through brain-computer interface. Since the wearable headset employs BCI technology and is compatible with patients lying down, it will effectively serve the needs of the LIS community.

***1c. Huntington’s Disease*** 

Although Huntington’s Disease presents many motor impairment difficulties (further examined in *Deep Dive: Motor Impairments and Fatigue*) due to chorea, strictly orthopedic disqualifiers aren’t generally present. Dystonia, or muscle rigidity and contracture, can be present in the neck or trunk and warrants clinical consideration.

***1d. Rett Syndrome*** 

Rett syndrome presents with several orthopedic comorbidities potentially affecting brain-computer interface headset candidacy. First, girls with Rett Syndrome have bone fragility increasing the chance of fractures, however there is literature suggesting this decreased bone density has no correlation to impaired ambulatory abilities. Therefore, the degree of ambulatory impairment is a motor impairment concern, not orthopedic. Comorbid Scoliosis in patients with Rett Syndrome is very common with increased rates of typical and severe scoliosis. Patients with scoliosis may have pain with neck and head movements, making them more ideal candidates for eye-tracking or brain computer interface speech generating devices. Orthopedic clinical consideration is warranted for patients with Rett Syndrome, but exclusion is unlikely due to solely structural concerns.

***1e. Spinal Cord Injuries*** 

Patients with Spinal Cord Injuries causing quadriplegia experience paralysis due to orthopedic injury, but most patients maintain the ability to move their necks and heads. Clinical consideration is necessary to determine the extent of head and neck motion, but patients with typical control will be viable candidates for head-wand pointing, eye-tracking and brain computer interface speech generating devices (SGDs). Even patients with limited neck and head movement will qualify for eye-tracking and brain computer interface SGDs.

***1f. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (MD)*** 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a musculoskeletal disorder is characterized by decreased muscle tone and control, as well as increased likelihood or skeletal comorbidities. Decreased trunk and neck muscles and control make head-wand speech generating devices less viable especially in more progressed cases. Joint contractures in the neck and trunk may also limit range of motion of the head. Some patients may experience comorbid scoliosis which can cause pain in head and neck movements. Osteoporosis is another comorbid orthopedic condition for patients with DMD that can cause painful bone fractures, but these will most likely not affect the use of a wearable headset.

***1g. Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)*** 

Multiple System Atrophy is a Parkinsonian type disease and is therefore connected to some movement disorders. Many of these are addressed in, *Deep Dive: Motor Impairments*, however some are due to orthopedic and structural factors. Joint contractures, muscle rigidity and bradykinesias can cause stiffness in muscles that makes controlled effective head movements more of a challenge. Patients with MSA will be ideal candidates for brain-computer interface and eye-tracking devices and will need clinical evaluation of individual capacity for motion to determine candidacy for head-wand SGDs.

***1h. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 2 (Dubowitz)*** 

Spinal Muscular Atrophy presents with muscle weakness from a young age causing patients to need support to stand or walk properly. Comorbid Scoliosis can cause pain in head and neck movements and in conjunction with the hypotonia will most likely exclude most patients from head-wand pointing SGDs although clinical evaluation is warranted. Eye-tracking and brain-computer interface are viable options for most patients with SMA.

***1i. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)*** 

ALS is a movement disorder caused by the degeneration of nerves in the brain and spinal cord that affect muscle control. Muscle weakness develops usually in an upper extremity and moves throughout the entire body. Muscle contractions and stiffness are possible side effects in addition to the hypotonia and lack of control. In early stage ALS most patients will have a fully functional head and neck and not need an SGD, however in later stages when speech and movement are more compromised, ALS patients become ideal candidates for brain-computer interface SGDs.

***1l. Multiple Sclerosis*** 

Multiple Sclerosis affects the body in multiple ways, some of which can be classified as orthopedic. The primary concern in MS patients is paralysis which can affect the extremities and the trunk and therefore impair head movements in some patients. Neck movements in Multiple Sclerosis can cause painful tingling sensations called Lhermitte’s signals. These signals can be an issue for head-wand pointing SGDs as user comfort is a priority. The lack of motion needed in brain-computer interface SGDs counters this potential disqualifier and makes MS patients ideal candidates.

***1m. Cerebral Palsy (CP)*** 

Cerebral palsy has many effects on the muscles of patients but many of these comorbidities will be covered in, *Deep Dive: Motor Impairments,* as they relate more the motion than structure of an individual. Spastic quadriplegia is a type of Cerebral Palsy that presents as most ideal for brain-computer interface since spasticity, increased muscle tone and stiffness, affects the trunk and face preventing intentional and controlled head-movements. Muscle contractures in any type of CP can further impair head movement. Neuromuscular Scoliosis can impair typical head placement and increase pain in head and neck movements.

**II. Conclusion** 

Many disorders needing Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices have symptoms or comorbid conditions affecting bone and muscular structure. None of these conditions should result in exclusion, however impaired neck or head movements due to these conditions warrant clinical determination of the best suited type of SGD. Pain during neck and head movements would also result in disqualification for head-pointing SGDs. None of these conditions affecting head and neck movement, pain or placement will result in disqualification from the brain-computer interface headset except for craniofacial abnormalities too severe to be compatible with the range of headset size adjustability.
