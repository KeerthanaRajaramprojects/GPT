Name,Notes
Epilepsy,The condition of being subject to any frequency of seizures. Plural: epilepsies.
Pathology,"The study of a condition's cause, processes, development, and consequence(s)."
Pathophysiology,"A fancier version of pathology that pathologists use when they know a condition has a discrete biologic origin (as opposed to pathophobic, pathopsychologic)"
Ideopathic,"A condition with no known biological origin; in recent years when we find something ideopathic with a uniquely identifiable genetic sequence we call that a ""de novo"" (brand new) mutation. So SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is genetically de novo, pathologic in its transmission, pathophysiological in its impact on cytokenes, and remains ideopathic in certain symptom manifestations. "
Grand Mal / Petit Mal,"Yeah we don't really use those terms anymore; part of a broader movement to not term physiological conditions as having a value judgment attached, which ""little bad"" and ""big bad"" definitely do. We have two main groups now."
Type 1: Generalized Seizures,"Characterized by involvement of all parts of the brain. There are two subtypes: 

Absence seizures (ex-""petit mal""), which are generally considered safe unless they extend beyond five minutes due to a risk of hypoxic brain injury. (hypo = low, oxic = oxygen)

Tonic-clonic seizures (ex-""grand mal""), which can have effects ranging from uninterpretable vocalizing to loss of consciousness to loss of balance, muscle jerks, and global muscular spasms. These are dangerous, not least of which for onlookers, but particularly for someone who may be - you know - strapped into a headset."
Type 2: Focal Seizures,"Seizures located in just one part of the brain, also ""partial seizures,"" broken into three categories:

Simple focal seizures have a small area of effect; the result can be a twitch, a change in sensation, etc.

Complex focal seizures impact multiple areas and tend to leave individuals dazed for a period of time (Rancho Level 5, for you clinical nerds out there)

Secondary generalized seizures begin as one of the above and then progress to impact the entire brain. This type of seizure is, in fact, our greatest concern when we are providing stimulus to the optical nerve. Which brings us to:"
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI),"BCI - or the type we're building, anyway - uses evoked potentials, which can be summed up as a highly distinct or unusual input to the sensory apparatus. We are using evoked potentials that target the occipital cortex via the optic nerve for a variety of reasons. These go by a variety of terms in the literature, but most formally they are:"
Steady-State Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs),"As opposed to just a visual evoked potential (VEP), which does not have as long-lasting an effect on a user's distinctive brain signal, steady-state evoked potentials flash at a consistent rate - picture waves crashing on a shore, but in this case the waves are peaks and troughs in the signal coming from your occipital nerve. Because the signal generated by each SSVEP is measurably different, we can use electroencephalography (EEG - literally translated to ""zap brain to map it"") and - given the right signal to noise ratio, which is where good hardware and algorithms come in - infer their thoughts across a theoretically infinite number of axes if we had no constraints with finances or cranial real estate."
Photosensitive Epilepsy,"Fortunately, only about 3% of people with an epilepsy diagnosis are triggered by flashing lights - and only at specific intensities, frequencies, or visual patterns. Research indicates it is more common in juveniles, particularly juvenile myoclonic (twitching) seizures and even more particularly when that twitching is centralized around their eyelid (Jeavon's syndrome). "
"So what triggers that 3%, then?","Unfortunately there isn't a huge body of research on photosensitive juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, because human subjects boards tend not to approve studies that involve subjecting children to potentially fatal seizures. There have been a number of articles written about the Pokémon incident of the 90s (or as the Japanese authors put it, the ""Pocket Monsters,"" but we do know quite a bit nonetheless."
So again ... what triggers that 3%?,"Research has consistently found the following:

* Television screens with flickering/rolling images, particularly under 20hz.
* Video games and other programming that rapidly flash alternating color patterns.
* Intense strobe lights like the ones we put in every American school for fire drills.
* Static or moving visual patterns that include stripes of contrasting colors.
* There is no conclusive evidence that emergency vehicle lights are a trigger, but many individuals with epilepsy avoid them anyway.

As above, we also consistently know some factors that can either help or hurt the situation:

* Frequency is a predictor, with faster in this case being better. One study found a subject who experienced photosensitive epilepsy with stimulus as low as 2hz, but a good rule of thumb is to avoid 5 to 30 flashes per second.
* Brightness is a factor (bright = worse).
* High contrast with background colors and lighting is a trigger.
* Distance between the viewer and the source is helpful.
* Certain wavelengths of light are particularly problematic (more on that later).
* It might seem obvious but ... whether a person's eyes are open or closed."
But wait - that's exactly the kind of stimulus we need for our BCI application.,"Yes, it is. But, a few things:

* As mentioned above, only 3% of individuals with epilepsy are triggered by SSVPs, so that's a relatively small group - and one we can define pretty precisely.

* There is also a great deal of variability among ""ideopathic"" photosensitive epilepsy - for one thing, many age out of the experience in their late 20s; for another, there are some experimental treatments. For example, in 1980 doctors on the US operated to correct nystagmus on a pair of identical twins, one of whom had photosensitive epilepsy and the other did not; after the surgery, neither of them did.

* Photosensitivity appears to be an uncommon feature rather than a hallmark of a specific type of epilepsy; juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has repeatedly been found to have twelve to eighteen times the comorbidity with psychiatric disorders (a separate tragedy, of course), and the presence of photosensitive seizures has proven an important diagnostic measure after traumatic brain injury.

* Finally, outside of contrast and other factors listed above, frequency - measured in Hz - is a major factor both in photosensitive epilepsy and in SSVEPs, which is something we can control for within reason. Where we cannot control for it we simply will be unable to serve a portion of the population, a fact that is tragic but minuscule in impact."
So what frequencies are problematic?,"That's complicated.

* The most prominent oscillation in the spontaneous EEG exists in a frequency band of 8–12 Hz (alpha band of frequencies) and have multiple cognitive correlates but for the vast majority are ""safe""

* The range between 13 and 30 Hz (originally β, beta) is most frequently associated with typical photosensive epilepsy

* For 30-80Hz (γ, gamma); photosensitive seizures occurring at that amplitude tend to have comorbidies of specifically ADHD, Schizophrenia, and Alzheimers, where they have been observed to demonstrate the perceptual distortions usually associated with complex focal seizures. However, one study in the U.K. discovered an individual triggered to seize while playing video games under 50hz.

* It should be noted that EMG activity is found >40 Hz, so there is a higher risk for EMG artifacts (especially if we're looking at signals close to the neck) if we look at gamma band

* Waves from 0-4Hz (δ, delta) and 4-8hz (θ, theta) ranges have been shown to pose dangers to a very small group of individuals, but evidence indicates the frequency may have been less a factor than the contrast or other factors in the stimulus.

* The Omega (ω) range of 80-120Hz has not been found to have any causative effect in epilepsy, but is also not of interest for SSVEP-based BCI - although we have known for fifty years that EEGs can detect oscillations up to 600Hz.

Some research indicates that these oscillations as they interact with brain waves can create ""phase synchrony,"" a kind of harmonics that can be either facilitating - like toasting a glass - or destructive, like dropping the glass. For some reason, those with photosensitive epilepsy seem prone to induced harmonics at certain wavelengths that either focally or generally impact their cognitive and motor functioning. This is consistent with the findings of recent FMRI studies focused on gamma oscillations."
