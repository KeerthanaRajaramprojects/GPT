# Type 1: Generalized Seizures

Notes: Characterized by involvement of all parts of the brain. There are two subtypes: 

Absence seizures (ex-"petit mal"), which are generally considered safe unless they extend beyond five minutes due to a risk of hypoxic brain injury. (hypo = low, oxic = oxygen)

Tonic-clonic seizures (ex-"grand mal"), which can have effects ranging from uninterpretable vocalizing to loss of consciousness to loss of balance, muscle jerks, and global muscular spasms. These are dangerous, not least of which for onlookers, but particularly for someone who may be - you know - strapped into a headset.
