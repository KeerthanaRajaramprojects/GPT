Visual Comorbidities

*Eye-tracking software and BCI calibration necessary for the use of AR devices require a certain degree of visual functioning. Complete blindness is an immediate disqualifier for all current Cognixion AAC devices. Visual abnormalities involving partial blindness or uncontrolled movement supply increased difficulties for effective use but must be evaluated case by case as there is no definite standard for exclusion. Many of the addressable disorders are affected by visual comorbidities and therefore require special attention. Visual issues while important as they can result in immediate exclusion, do not provide an extreme liability as further damage or injury of the occipital lobe, ocular nerve or eyes themselves would be virtually impossible (with the exception of perhaps someone stabbing themselves in the eye which is more of a behavioral than visual issue). It is worth noting that far or nearsightedness are easily addressed since contacts and glasses are compatible for simultaneous use with the AR headset.* 

Comorbidities:

- Ptosis - Abnormal low-lying or drooping upper eyelid.
- Diplopia - Seeing two images of an object, also known as double vision.
- Retinal Interneuron Degeneration - atrophy of eye neural signaling cells
- Refractive Errors - the shape of the eye does not bend light correctly, resulting in a blurred image.
- Esotropia - Misaligned eye turned inward
- Exotropia - Misaligned eye turned outward
- Hypertropia - Misaligned eye turned upward
- Hypotropia - Misaligned eye turned downward
- Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) - Visual impairment due to a brain injury preventing the interpretation of images seen with the properly functioning eyes
- Oculomotor Apraxia - the absence or defect of controlled, voluntary, and purposeful eye movement.
- Cortical Blindness - total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye caused by damage to the brain's occipital cortex
- Insufficient Convergence - a sensory and neuromuscular anomaly of the [binocular vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision) system, characterized by a reduced ability of the [eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_eyes) to turn towards each other
- Blepharospasm - Uncontrolled squeezing or twitching of the eyelids.
- Blepharitis - An inflammation of the eyelid that affects the eyelashes or tear production.
- Nystagmus - An involuntary eye movement which may cause the eye to rapidly move from side to side, up and down, or in a circle, and may slightly blur vision.
- Ophthalmoplegia - paralysis of the muscles within or surrounding the eye.
- Saccadic Movements - A quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction. In contrast, in smooth pursuit movements, the eyes move smoothly instead of in jumps.
- Extraocular Muscle Atrophy - Paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye due to cell death
- Optic Neuritis - Inflammation of the optic nerve.
- Scotoma - A partial loss of vision or blind spot in an otherwise normal visual field.
- Hemianopsia - a loss of vision or blindness in half the visual field
- Strabismus - a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other when looking at an object.
- Cataracts - a cloudy area in the lens of your eye causing blurry vision
- Central Field Loss - a small dark spot in the center of the vision that gets larger over time.
- Peripheral Field Loss - The inability to see objects unless they're right in front of you. This is also known as tunnel vision.

Disorder specific comorbidities in ideal diseases:

Myasthenia Gravis

*There are several visual comorbidities associated with Myasthenia Gravis. As a neurodegenerative muscle disorder, MG can lead to loss of control in the muscles surrounding the eye and the eyelids. This lack of control can cause ptosis (an abnormally low-lying or drooping upper eyelid). Patients with Myasthenia Gravis are also commonly afflicted with diplopia (double vision). Neither of these visual limitations are grounds for immediate exclusion, however they should be considered during clinical evaluation* 

- The lack of muscle control associated with myasthenia gravis often causes ptosis and compromises vision. Remediation is often as rudimentary as taping eyelids up. This lack of control could provide a long-term user issue if it affects the AR choice but with extra care it shouldn’t be disqualifying.
- Diplopia is another major side effect for MG patients. This may be disqualifying as it seems to prove a significant barrier for AR effectiveness however optometrists can counter the severity of the double vision with specialized eyeglass prisms.

Locked-In Syndrome

- No clear visual comorbidities

Huntington’s Disease

*Huntington’s Disease has been associated with several optical conditions which may impair effective use of an augmented reality headset. The most typical of these abnormalities being slow and uncontrolled eye movement due to muscle and neural deterioration. Retinal interneuron degeneration (atrophy of eye neural signaling cells) has been selectively found in patients with Huntington's Disease. Some literature connecting Huntington’s Disease to impaired color vision exists and should be clinically considered, however it is worth noting that AR technology relies most heavily on color identification in candidates with lower literacy levels. Since Huntington’s Disease is progressive, most affected individuals with be literate and not as reliant on color identification. None of these conditions are immediately exclusive, however should be clinically considered. Retinal interneuron degeneration poses the largest threat for exclusion depending on its severity as the atrophy may prevent signaling essential to proper functioning of the headset and its electrodes.* 

- HD has several optical affects often resulting slow and uncontrolled eye movements
- HD can result in impaired color vision which can be problematic depending on the necessity of colors in the AR headset choices, although HD patients usually are literate as the disease is progressive and late onset so reading should not be an issue and therefore distinguishing colors may be less important
- There is evidence that HD selectively causes retinal interneuron degeneration which can affect field of view and focus

Rett Syndrome

*Rett syndrome is not typically characterized by ocular impairment, however some visual disorders occur at higher than average incidence. Girls with Rett Syndrome may be more readily subject to intermittent esotropia (inward turning eyes), cortical visual impairment (if severe enough can result in immediate exclusion) or oculomotor apraxia (a- can't; praxis – do) (lack of eye control). Although not generally present in girls with Rett Syndrome, CVI and oculomotor apraxia severely affect vision and will most likely result in more common clinical exclusion than similar visual disorders. Finally, Rett Syndrome causes a significantly higher than average rate of refractive errors (blurry vison fixed with corrective lenses) more commonly known as near or far-sightedness. The immediately evident solution to this issue is the employment of corrective lenses which are compatible with the AR headset, meaning clinical consideration is unnecessary.* 

- RS causes higher than average refractive errors (blurry vison fixed with corrective lenses), but this should not pose an issue since glasses and contacts work with the AR headset
- Girls with RS may have intermittent esotropia (inward turning eyes), cortical visual impairment (if severe enough can result in immediate exclusion) or oculomotor apraxia (a- can't; praxis – do) (lack of eye control).

Spinal Cord Injuries

Although there is some literature documenting cortical blindness following SCIs, these cases are rare and easily identifiable and disqualifying. This low incidence comorbidity certainly does not exclude most tetraplegic SCIs.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

*Although many muscular dystrophies and other neurodegenerative muscular disorders result in impaired ocular control due to atrophy of the eye muscles, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in most literature appears to present normal eye muscle development and control. Extra clinical consideration is therefore not necessary for patients with Duchenne without the presence of a clear comorbidity not specifically linked to DMD.* 

- The muscles controlling eye movement are impaired in many muscular dystrophies but in DMD eye muscles are normal

Multiple System Atrophy

*Due to the nature of Multiple System Atrophy, lack of muscle definition and control are common throughout the body including the eyes and ocular systems. This muscular impairment emerges through several visual comorbidities including insufficient convergence (eyes cannot focus together), slow or jerky eye movement, Blepharospasm (involuntary eyelid closure), Blepharitis (eyelid irritation due to eyelash infection) and Nystagmus (uncontrolled constant motion of the eyes). None of these conditions warrant immediate clinical exclusion but have the potential to be disqualifying if severe enough. They should be clinically considered and may be good candidates for modifications to the base headset.* 

- Muscles controlling eye movement can be impaired resulting in insufficient convergence (eyes cannot focus together) and slow or jerky eye movement
- Blepharospasm (involuntary eyelid closure) could affect headset use however it can be treated with Botox injections which have proved to be effective for increments of around four months
- Blepharitis (eyelid irritation due to eyelash infection) is common but easily treated or irritation and discomfort however an increased sensitivity to light may make the AR display less comfortable
- Nystagmus - uncontrolled constant motion of the eyes is a possible comorbidity as well

SMA Type 2 Dubowitz

*Although many muscular dystrophies and other neurodegenerative muscular disorders result in impaired ocular control due to atrophy of the eye muscles, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type II (Dubowitz) in most literature appears to present normal eye muscle development and control.* 

- Eye muscles are usually unaffected in type 2

ALS

*Although Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is not typically associated with visual impairment or structural ocular abnormalities, there is literature suggesting that rare visual comorbidities may exist, such as ophthalmoplegia (eye and muscle paralysis), irregular saccades (choppy/jumpy eye movements), as well as nystagmus (vibration of the muscles controlling the eyes). These conditions should be considered, but do not warrant clinical exclusion; rather, some adaptation may be desired. However, late-stage ALS does present consistently with extraocular muscle atrophy, making BCI access solutions more appropriate than eye or head pointing measures in the (typically brief) terminal phase.* 

- Ocular motor function is mostly unaffected but there is some, but rare, literature documenting conditions such as ophthalmoplegia (eye and eye muscle paralysis), saccadic movements (choppy, jumping eyes instead of smooth flowing) as well as nystagmus
- Extraocular muscle atrophy does occur in the terminal phase of the disease

MS

*Visual impairment does present consistently with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as the majority of patients experience optic neuritis (loss or disturbance of vision and pain going with eye movement). Optic neuritis seems to prove an immediate concern for disqualification as the pain could warrant clinical disqualification. Complete loss of vision due to optic neuritis would result in clinical exclusion. Patients with multiple sclerosis are also at risk of affliction from less common visual comorbidities such as diplopia (double vision), nystagmus (uncontrolled constant motion of the eyes), scotoma (blind spot in middle of vision) or hemianopsia (loss of vision in the right or left fields of both eyes). These conditions are not grounds for disqualification but should be clinically considered. Multiple Sclerosis patients may be candidates for headset adaptations due to the range of visual comorbidities associated with the disorder.* 

- Around half of MS patients experience optic neuritis (loss or disturbance of vision and pain going with eye movement)
- MS patients are also subject to potential diplopia and nystagmus
- Some patients may experience scotoma (blind spot in middle of vision) or hemianopsia (loss of vision in the right or left fields of both eyes.

CP

*Visual impairment can be considered a defining characteristic of cerebral palsy as it affects the vast majority of the population. Most commonly, patients with cerebral palsy are affected by strabismus (severely turned eye that does not allow for eyes to work together), cataracts (clouding over the eye that blurs vision) or refractive issues (when the eyes cannot focus). Additional literature suggests the presence of more rare comorbidities with cerebral palsy including hemianopia, central or peripheral field loss, oculomotor concerns where the eye is turned an unwanted direction, or CVI (loss of brain function causing difficulty interpreting what is being seen). With the exception of severe CVI, most visual ailments affecting people with cerebral palsy are not disqualifying, but all patients with cerebral palsy warrant additional clinical consideration due to the high incidence and range of visual comorbidities.* 

- Vision problems are very common up to ¾ of patients affected
- Patients are most affected by strabismus (severely turned eye that does not allow for eyes to work together), cataracts (clouding over the eye that blurs vision) or refractive issues (when the eyes cannot focus).
- Other ailments include hemianopia, central or peripheral field loss, oculomotor concerns where the eye is turned an unwanted direction, or CVI (loss of brain function causing difficulty interpreting what is being seen).

Conclusion:

*The ubiquitous presence of visual comorbidities in degenerative muscle disorders and other AR headset candidates poses a significant procedural challenge due to the visual nature of the device. BCI should nullify the concern of comorbidities decreasing eye control as the technology can detect intention without physical execution, but random, uncontrolled motion may increase the difficulty of device setup. Vision failure and blindness is a more immediate disqualifying concern. Users must be able to clearly see all AR options and interpret what they see. Partial or complete blindness could inhibit the ability for comprehensible communication or communication at all using the device. The majority of ocular issues will require a physician’s presence but not result in exclusion. Complete blindness is cause for immediate exclusion, partial blindness will most likely result in immediate or eventual exclusion, however depending on severity may qualify.*
