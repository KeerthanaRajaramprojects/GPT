They learn to talk by imitating the sounds they hear around them and the voices of their parents and caregivers. But that\u2019s not true for all children. In fact, about two or three out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born with detectable hearing loss in one or both ears. More lose hearing later during childhood. Children who have hearing loss may not learn speech and language as well as children who can hear. For this reason, it\u2019s important to detect hearing loss as early as possible. Because of the need for prompt identification of and intervention for childhood hearing loss, universal newborn hearing screening programs currently operate in all U.S. states and most U.S. territories. With help from the federal government, every state has established an Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Program. As a result, about 98% of babies have their hearing screened before 1 month of age. The most important time for a child to learn language (spoken or signed) is in the first 3 years of life, when the brain is developing and maturing. In fact, children with typical hearing begin learning speech and language in the first 6 months of life. This is why it is so important to screen and start interventions for hearing loss as early as possible. Research shows that children with hearing loss who get help early develop better language skills than those who don\u2019t. Your baby\u2019s hearing should be screened before he or she leaves the hospital or birthing center. If not, make sure the baby is tested during the first month of life. If your baby\u2019s hearing was not tested within 1 month of birth, or if you haven\u2019t been told the results of the hearing screening, ask your child\u2019s doctor today. Quick action will be important if the screening shows potential hearing loss. A newborn undergoes a hearing screening. Two different tests are used to screen for hearing loss in babies. Your baby can rest or sleep during both tests. If the results show that your baby may have hearing loss, make an appointment with a pediatric audiologist\u2014a hearing expert who specializes in the assessment and management of children with hearing loss. This follow-up exam should be done as soon as possible, ideally by the time the baby is 2 to 3 months old. The audiologist will conduct tests to determine whether your baby has a hearing problem and, if so, the type and extent of that problem. If you need help finding a pediatric audiologist, ask your pediatrician or the hospital staff who conducted your baby\u2019s screening. They may even be able to help you schedule an appointment. You can also try the directories provided by the\u00a0American Academy of Audiology\u00a0or the\u00a0American Speech\u2013Language\u2013Hearing Association. If the follow-up examination confirms that your baby has hearing loss, he or she should begin receiving intervention services as soon as possible, ideally by the age of 3 to 6 months. See our\u00a0Baby\u2019s hearing screening and next steps: Timeline for parents (below)\u00a0for a guide to follow. The pediatric audiologist may recommend that your baby visit a pediatric ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician who specializes in conditions affecting the ear, known as a pediatric otologist. A pediatric otologist can determine possible causes of hearing loss and recommend intervention options. If your child has siblings, the audiologist or otologist may also recommend that their hearing be tested. Not necessarily. Hearing loss can occur at any time of life. Some inherited forms of hearing loss don\u2019t appear until a child is older. If your baby was exposed to certain infections before being born, they are more likely to have gradual hearing loss during childhood. Other factors, such as childhood illness, ear infection, head injury, certain medications, and loud noise are also linked to hearing loss in children. Use\u00a0Your Baby\u2019s Hearing and Communicative Development Checklist\u00a0to monitor and track your child\u2019s communication milestones through age 5. If you have concerns about your child\u2019s hearing at any age, talk to your pediatrician right away. When interventions begin early, children with hearing loss can develop language skills that help them communicate freely and learn actively. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that all children with disabilities have access to the services they need to get a good education. Your community may also offer additional services to help support your child. Your baby\u2019s health care team will help you find services and methods to overcome communication barriers. You may also be referred to a speech-language pathologist or a teacher who is experienced in working with children with hearing loss. Talk to and communicate with your child often and stay up-to-date with all health care appointments. Depending on your baby\u2019s hearing loss and communication needs, some of these devices and tools may help to maximize his or her communication skills. With training, children with cochlear implants can learn to recognize sounds and understand speech. Studies have also shown that many eligible children who receive a cochlear implant early (before 18 months of age) can develop spoken language skills at a rate comparable to children with normal hearing, and many succeed in mainstream classrooms. Some doctors now recommend the use of two cochlear implants, one for each ear. An audiologist or otolaryngologist who specializes in cochlear implants can help you decide if a cochlear implant is appropriate for your child. Read the NIDCD fact sheet\u00a0Cochlear Implants\u00a0for more information. Children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can learn to communicate in several ways. Find out as much as you can about the communication choices and ask your health care team to refer you to experts if you want to know more. Because language development begins early, regardless of the communication mode you choose, you should engage with your child and begin intervention as soon as possible. Common approaches used to help children with hearing loss communicate and interact with others include: Like all children, children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can develop strong academic, social, and emotional skills and succeed in school. Find out how your school system helps children with hearing loss. With your input, your child\u2019s school will develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) for your child, and you should ask if an educational audiologist is available to be part of the academic team. Explore programs outside of school that may help you and your child and talk with other parents who have already dealt with these issues. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that children with hearing loss receive free, appropriate, early-intervention services from birth through the school years.
