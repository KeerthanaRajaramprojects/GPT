                                             Results: Nineteen single case experimental design studies with 66 participants
                                             (Mage = 4.9 years) met inclusion criteria. All but one study featured requesting as the
                                             primary dependent variable. Visual analysis and meta-analysis indicated no differ-
                                             ences between use of SGDs and picture exchange for children learning to request.
                                             Children demonstrated preferences for and learned to request more successfully
                                             with SGDs than with manual sign. Children who preferred picture exchange also
                                             learned to request more easily with picture exchange than with SGDs.
