Context: Alice and Brian are in their living room, watching a movie together. Alice is positioned in her recliner, while Brian sits on the couch nearby. The ambient temperature is warm, and the lighting is dim. It's evening, and both are slightly tired from the day's activities.
Turn 1:
    1. Output: "I'm tired."

    3. Interaction sequence: a. Autocomplete: "I'm" (1 interaction, 1 second) b. Phrase prediction: "tired" (1 interaction, 1 second)
    4. AF>>why does she need to type "I'm"? Why not just "slee" and predict all relevant expressions related to sleepy including "tired"? Or is this a use case for prefrontal eeg sensors or eye tracking to acknowledge physiological states?
    5. Contextual impact: The ALS user's fatigue level and the evening timing influenced the phrase prediction.
    6. Prediction influence: Fatigue level and evening timing had a strong impact, while other factors had little to no influence.
    7. Default keyboard interactions: "I'm" (keyboard input), "tired" (next word prediction)
