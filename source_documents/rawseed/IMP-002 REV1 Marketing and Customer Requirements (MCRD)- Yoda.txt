3 Stakeholder Analysis
3.1 Users - ALS Patients
ALS is a progressive and irreversibly debilitating disease that adversely affects motor neurons, causing muscles to weaken and eventually paralyze.  At the end stage, people have their cognitive capabilities and intact senses but no ability to move, appearing to others as statues. In other words, it's possible for ALS patients to see, hear, and feel pain, but no ability to respond to these stimuli.

Figure 1 ALS Patient With Cognixion One Axon Headset (Image Used With Signed Consent Of Patient).
ALS has no cure and the average life expectancy after diagnosis is two to five years with wide ranging varability.  Most challenging is that ALS is only diagnosed as an exclusion of all other diseases, and as such, it could take an average of a full year to diagnose these patients, by which point the symptoms can be significant.  Early in the disease progression, ALS can affect patients' oral and throat muscles making swallowing and speaking very difficult. 
Most challenging of all is that the average age of people diagnosed with this disease is in their late 50's and early 60's.  Like the patient in the image above, they might be parents  in their prime, unable to complete their life's work, give important life lessons to their children or simply tell their family that they love them 
There are no solutions for lengthening the time that ALS patients can communicate today.  Cognixion's goal is to maximize this time by providing a device that is both portable and evolves with the patient as their needs and abilities change.  Below is an outline of how the Cognixion ONE Axon is envisioned to support patients throughout the progression of their disease.The average age of people diagnosed with ALS is in their late 50's and early 60's, and with specific genetic risk factors can be diagnosed as early as their 30's .  
The Milano-Torino Staging (ALS-MITOS1 ) is used for a general description of the stages below, which capture the progressive loss of independence and function observed in ALS patients. ALS-MITOS incorporates the inputs of ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), which reflects the progressive loss of function in four key areas: fine motor control, gross motor control, speaking/swallowing, and breathing.
3.1.1 ALS Patient in Stage 0
Day in the Life
At this stage, patients have finally received a diagnosis for their collection of ailments of muscle twitches, cramps, and weakness.  It is a terrible diagnosis and patients have a hard time accepting the prognosis.  As they grapple with the debilitating verdict, an army of specialists, doctors, support staff, and insurance claims, the muscles that enable them to speak weaken.  Patients are encouraged to begin "voice banking"2 but the process is onerous and time consuming.  Many believe they have time to complete this task in the future, but in reality, they do not.  Most spend the first critical few months in denial and lose this precious time
Current Solution: 
At this stage patients do not have any communication devices.  To bank their voice they  need to go to the ALS/MD Associations to learn how or attempt this process at home.  - a process that takes  hours of mind-numbing repetition.
Cognixion Vision:
Enable gathering of patient voice through passive, ambient data collection through an  app that the patient can set to listen at key moments. In the future, additional voice data gathering could occur through games designed to collect critical data while creating an enjoyable experience.
Goals
Live as much of my life as quickly as possible - finish the things that are important to me.
Navigate the dizzying array of specialists and insurance claims with minimal disruption to my life.
Prepare for what's coming.
Challenges and opportunities for Cognixion
Products today don't support the entire ALS journey - Provide a one-and-done product as early as possible, preferably walking them through the insurance process.
Voice Banking is challenging and exhausting - Enable voice capture in as non-invasive and non-disruptive way as possible.

3.1.2 STAGE 1-2 - Loss of One To Two Types Of Functions 
Day in the Life
Patient Experience:
At this stage, patients are experiencing muscle weakness affecting the arms, legs, neck or diaphragm.  They have difficulty chewing or swallowing and their voice may be slurred or nasal due to weakened throat muscles and vocal cords.  ALS does not progress in a linear fashion.  Instead, patients may suddenly lose ability to use a muscle, only to regain the ability hours or days later.  Despite this temporary improvement, it creates a false sense of hope as the disease inevitably progresses to further loss of capabilities. 
 Current Solution:
A number of touch screen/eye tracking solutions  exist and depend on the ability of the patient to access the device in a consistent manner.  However, these devices were primarily developed with the intent of the user accessing the device with their hands and at a distance, meaning it is attached to their wheelchair and mounted 24-36 inches away. Therefore, the language interface as well as the access method tends to have points of failure for clients with ALS.  Current devices are  better suited towards young people and childrren, instead of adults in the prime of their life and cognitive capabilitieswith more sophisticated language and more complicated access needs. 
Additionally, the current communication solutions cause the user to be focused on a device in their lap or between themselves and the person with whom they are communicating, causing a further interaction disconnect.  . These current communication devices do not allow the user and their loved ones to have effective and efficient discourse opportunities.
Cognixion Vision:
The Cognixion ONE Axon is designed to evoke the futuristic gaming headsets in the consumer electronics world, inspiring interest in others.  Unlike existing solutions, the patient can verbalize, interact with their environment and project the phrase they have composed to their loved ones, increasing the probability that they will be understood and able to hold the focus of the person to whom they are communicating.  
Interaction is also more natural since the user is facing their communication partner and they are able to see one another's face.  As an augmented reality system, the patient and their communication partner are able to look at each other through the lens, since the system is able to project the user interface on a see-through lens as illustrated here. Commmunication (decoding) is 80% non-verbal and being able to see each others facial expressions is paramount towards effective communication.With integration to Alexa, the patient regains a sense of autonomy as they are able to control their home devices through the headset, enabling them to do such things as turn music on and off, watch TV or make calls without help.

Goals
Communicate to my loved ones and/or colleagues as effectively as possible
Minimize time I spend on anything other than getting my affairs in order and/or completing the work I want to (Parenting, Writing a Book, etc.)
Challenges and opportunities for Cognixion 
Touch screen & eye tracking devices are between the User and their communication partner - Provide a way that maximises person-to-person interaction & communication.  
Agency disappears by the day - Provide a way to leverage the internet of things.

Likes in Current Offerings
Ability to use electronic communication - texts, social media, etc.
Dislikes in Current Offerings
Touch screen less and less usable due to muscle weakness.  Eye tracking doesn't work well unless perfectly positioned and doesn't work well outside.

Current Assistive Communication Systems (Standard of Care):
Existing Device(s)
Benefit - Stages 1-2
Limitations - Stages 1-2
Commercial Touchscreens such as an iPad
    - Many already understand how to use
    - Leverages existing email, text & social media access
    - Allows patient with loss of throat/vocal control to use hand abilities to communicate.
    - No additional cost if such a system is already being used in the home
    - Prediction is unsophisticated. 
    - Ineffective for creating audible speech (e.g. for people standing next to the user)
    - Not supportive of deteriorating muscle control
    - Requires fine muscle control which can limit successful use
AAC Eye Tracking (standard of care)
    - Device fine-tuned for AAC use
    - Creates audible speech
    - Presents created text in a forward-facing display
    - Efficient composition of spoken word, esp  vs. hand composition such as iPad
    - Insurance covers
    - Can mount to wheelchairs and/or beds
    - Once situated, does not depend on caregiver to activate
    - Dependent on stable (and immobile) set up to patient eyes - often mounted to a wheelchair, if one it exists.
    - Eye tracking as only modality can be tiresome to user
    - Dependent on insurance to obtain and requires manufacturing company to set up - which can involve delay in obtaining and using.
    - Eye tracking is not effective in sun/daylight conditions due to sensor limitations.
    - Operation requires learning curve for use and may not readily connect to email, text and social media 
    - Not supportive of deteriorating muscle control

3.1.3 STAGES 2-3 - Loss of Two to Three Types of Functions 
Day in the Life
Patient Experience:
The disease has progressed significantly at this point.  Muscle weakness and atrophy has spread to multiple parts of the body. Some muscles become paralyzed, while others lose strength. ALS does not progress in a linear fashion meaning that at times - often throughout a day - the patient may have neck movement and later only be able to move their eyes.  Patients may be able to vocalize using grunts and ability to use a switch would be limited.
 Current Solution:
 Current solutions available to these patients involve eye tracking since touch screens are no longer a viable choice.  Moreover, the systems are large and burdensome.  They need to be carefully positioned in front of the patient to be accurate, which creates a visual block between the patient and the very people with whom they are trying to communicate.  This positioning issue causes unnatural interactions as the caregiver needs to peer around the device to see the patient.

Figure 4 Patient Utilizing Commercially Available Ects Device

Since the patient's muscles weaken inconsistently, it is easy for them to list or drift in position, getting them out of position to use the eye tracking causing further frustration.  Even in the best of cases, composition of thoughts is slow and arduous, filled with numerous mis-selections and difficulty making any selection at all.  
It is also a challenge to position the system while the user is on the go out in the community and sunlight often causes these systems to become unusable.  Some abandon these systems altogether and resort to rudimentary communications that the patient and their circle of care develop through gestures and grunts.  People in the community mistake a lack of ability to communicate with a lack of cognitive ability, further irritating users and their loved ones. At this stage with inconsisent communication abilities ALS patients have reported increased depression and increased desire to be involved in activities.
Cognixion Vision:
The industrial design of the headset was developed to inspire interest and discussion.  The system is designed so that the display is in the correct position with minimal adjustment allowing everyone to be focused on communicating rather than the technology enabling that communication.  
The user interface that has served the patient through the earlier stages continues to be relevant, leveraging the built expertise of the patient.  The interaction mode can easily change from head movement to eye tracking based on the user's particular abilities in the moment.  
Since the system has been learning the patient's particular turn of word, predicted words and phrases make composition faster.  The voice banked at the beginning of this journey is now used to maintain the patient's humanity and familiarity to their loved ones.  Having their voice expressed to their spouse and children often provide them a feeling of warmth.  It has been reported that hearing their dad say "I love you" often means more to the child that the patient.
Like the language system, the library of saved phrases is likewise growing, allowing users to vocalize AND project phrases such as "Please give me a moment to compose my thoughts" with a single button, eliciting patience and anticipation from those around them.  This increase speed to access language with fewer "clicks" supports their continued need for normal language with fewer movements needed.

3.1.4 STAGE 4 - Loss Of Most If Not All Types Of Function
Day in the Life
Patient Experience:
In this final stage, patients lose most if not all of their voluntary muscles.  While studies continue to gather an understanding of the patient's experience at this point, it is believed that cognitive function remains intact, as do the rest of their senses.  This stage, illustrated by this patient, is considered clinically locked-in and the patient experiences complete paralysis.  
While eye movement tends to cease last (because the eyes are bilaterally innervated by the brain), movement becomes erratic and control becomes ever more difficult.  As in the other stages, progression is not linear and abilities may be improved or degraded throughout the day In short they may start the day with better muscular control but as the day progresses this control fades.
Current Solution:
 Beyond current eye tracking systems, there is no solution for locked-in patients today.  There are a number of invasive implantable solutions under development, but they would require surgical implants of probes in a patient's brain and are many years from completing technical development.  Most ALS patients are also not candidates for this implantable device as they would not tolerate the anesthesia and surgery required to place it.
As patients' muscle control continues to deteriorate, eye tracking,  which was already problematic in Stage 2 becomes very unreliable.  Their eyes tends to drift at times even though their gaze at the occipital level remains intact. .  Caregivers resort to tracking vital signs such as heart rate, skin temperature and blood pressure to give them hints on whether their patient is awake or in pain.  
We can't imagine what the patient must endure, being unable to communicate at all, perhaps being in pain and unable to communicate this to their caregivers. 
Cognixion Vision:
Using the same Cognixion headset that the user and caregiver have been using since Stage 1 , the patient would communicate using a combination of "visually evoked potentials" and non-invasive EEG electrodes.  Using the same eye tracking technology they had in previous stages, the system would be able to identify and adjust to the user's ability to control eye movement.  Ultimately the system would be able to move between receiving eye-tracking input and BCI, adjusting the interface and interaction to the user's physical abilities.  At a bare minimum, the user would be able to respond to Yes/No questions to communicate with their loved ones and caregivers without having to move at all.

3.2 Caregivers
3.2.1 Family Member
Day in the Life
Life has changed as dramatically for the patient's family as they grapple with the heartbreaking diagnosis and resulting effects.  Their day to day physical support of their loved one comes with the burden of emotional effort of keeping their own mental anguish at bay while juggling the requirements of their own school or job.  
Additionally, they are the first line of fire when it comes to understanding the diagnosis, treatments, equipment, house preparations (e.g. changing doorways to accommodate wheelchairs) and insurance claims.  Their burden is almost heavier than the patient's.  
At the same time, they are working ever harder to understand and anticipate the needs of their loved one, devising a myriad of communication methods and directing an army of additional clinicians and specialized caregivers.
Goals
Keep my loved one as comfortable and self-empowered as I can
Understand what my loved one is wishing to accomplish and help them accomplish it.
Minimize the overhead needed to treat and pay for all activities associated with this illness.
Get as much quality time with my loved one as possible.
Challenges
I can't hear what my loved one is communicating 
I can' t connect with my loved one because there is a large device between us
I am expected to be the device expert but I don't know how to do this and don't have time to add this to my existing load.
Likes

Ability to see and hear the user's communication
Ability for the user to be as autonomous as possible.
Dislikes
