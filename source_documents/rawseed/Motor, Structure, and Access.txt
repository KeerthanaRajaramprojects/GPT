Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
Motor Disorders 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons, leading to the loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis. ALS is characterized by the following motor disorders:
    - Progressive muscle weakness, affecting the limbs, trunk, and respiratory muscles
    - Spasticity, or increased muscle tone
    - Muscle atrophy, or wasting
    - Fasciculations, or muscle twitching
    - Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing
    - Dysarthria, or difficulty speaking due to muscle weakness and poor coordination

The specific motor disorders experienced may vary depending on the individual and the progression of the disease.
Access Needs 
As ALS progresses, individuals may lose their ability to communicate effectively using speech, necessitating the use of alternative communication methods. Access needs for individuals with ALS may include:
    - Eye gaze technology: As the individual loses control of their limbs and head, eye gaze technology may become the most effective means of communication.
    - Head pointing: In the earlier stages of ALS, head pointing may be an appropriate access method for those who still have some control over head movements.
    - Switch access: Some individuals may benefit from switch access using residual muscle control in their limbs or other body parts.
    - Brain-computer interface (BCI): In the most advanced stages of ALS, BCI technology may be the only viable access method for communication.
User Journey 
For individuals with ALS, the user journey typically involves several touchpoints with healthcare professionals and device manufacturers, including:
    1. Diagnosis and initial consultation with a neurologist
    2. Referral to a multidisciplinary ALS clinic or team, including SLPs, OTs, and ATPs
    3. Assessment by an SLP to determine appropriate alternative communication methods and devices
    4. Collaboration with an OT and ATP to identify the most suitable access method and necessary adaptations for the individual's motor abilities
    5. Customization and setup of the SGD by the DME SGD manufacturer, based on the individual's specific access needs
    6. Training and ongoing support from the multidisciplinary team, including the SLP, OT, ATP, and device manufacturer, to ensure effective use and device maintenance
ALS Persona: A Literate Adult 
John, a 55-year-old engineer, was diagnosed with ALS. After an initial consultation with a neurologist, John was referred to a multidisciplinary ALS clinic, where he met his team that includes an SLP, an OT, and an ATP. Together, they assessed John's communication and motor abilities to determine the most appropriate alternative communication methods and devices.

John's SLP found that his speech was becoming increasingly difficult to understand. The OT and ATP collaborated to identify the most suitable access method for John. They recommended an eye gaze system in combination with a speech-generating device to accommodate his progressive muscle weakness.

The DME SGD manufacturer customized the device according to John's specific access needs. The multidisciplinary team provided John with training on how to use the device effectively and ensured that he was comfortable with its features. They also provided ongoing support and device maintenance.
Cerebral Palsy
Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of neurological disorders that affect muscle movement and coordination. It is caused by abnormal brain development or damage that occurs before, during, or shortly after birth. The severity and type of motor impairment in CP can vary widely, from mild muscle stiffness to severe and complex motor dysfunction.
Common motor disorders include:
    - Spasticity, or increased muscle tone and stiffness, leading to limited range of motion and difficulty controlling movements
    - Dyskinesia, or involuntary, uncontrolled movements, which may include athetosis (slow, writhing movements) or dystonia (twisting or repetitive movements)
    - Ataxia, or impaired balance and coordination, resulting in unsteady and uncoordinated movements
    - Mixed motor disorders, which may involve a combination of spasticity, dyskinesia, and ataxia
Access 
Individuals with CP may have varying access needs, depending on the type and severity of their motor disorders. Access needs for individuals with CP may include:
    - Head pointing: For those with adequate head control, head pointing may be an effective access method.
    - Eye gaze technology: In cases where limb and head movements are severely impaired, eye gaze may be more suitable for communication.
    - Switch access: Switch access may be customized to accommodate the residual movement abilities of the individual, such as using foot or other body part switches.
    - Mixed modality access: Combining multiple access methods may provide users with the highest level of flexibility and adaptability to their motor limitations.
User Journey 
The user journey for individuals with CP involves interaction with healthcare professionals and SGD manufacturers, including:
    1. Diagnosis and initial consultation with a pediatric neurologist or developmental pediatrician
    2. Referral to a multidisciplinary team specializing in CP, including SLPs, OTs, and ATPs
    3. Assessment by an SLP to determine appropriate alternative communication methods and devices
    4. Collaboration with an OT and ATP to identify the most suitable access method and necessary adaptations for the user's motor abilities
    5. Customization and setup of the SGD by the DME SGD manufacturer, based on the user's specific access needs
    6. Training and ongoing support from the multidisciplinary team, including the SLP, OT, ATP, and device manufacturer, to ensure effective use, device maintenance, and skill development
