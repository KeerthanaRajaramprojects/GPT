1.3 Intended Use

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) product, a purpose built Speech Gener-
ating Device (SGD) designed to provide to its users increased communication ability and greater independence.

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is intended primarily to provide, and act as, a compliment to everyday communication for people
that have challenges in their ability to speak due to injury, disability or illness. This intended use is reflected in design features
such as long lasting batteries, superior sound quality, high durability, built in environmental control and connectivity features.

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is a Gaze Interaction device with a built-in Tobii Eye Tracker (optional) and a capacitive touch
screen for touch access. The device is intended to be used in two orientations: one, upright and mounted (or standing upright,
vertically, on an appropriate surface) for Gaze Interaction use, and two, lying flat (resting in a horizontal orientation) for touch ac-
cess optimization. Gaze Interaction and touch can be used in combination with switches, keyboard and/or scanning as addition-
al input methods.

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is designed primarily for face-to-face communication and secondarily for long distance communi-
cation, computer access and on-line social interaction. The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ allows the user to communicate via text or
symbols to generate synthesized (computer voice) or digitized (recorded voice) speech for face-to-face communication. The va-
riety of communication methods allows Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ users the ability to realize their full potential.

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ allows its user many options of communication through text message, chat and voice calls via Blue-
tooth® to cell phone, WiFi to Skype®, Internet to E-mail and other third party applications such as Facebook®.

With the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+, users have the freedom and flexibility provided via the Microsoft® Windows environment, as

2 Safety

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device has been tested and approved as compliant to all the Specifications and Standards listed
in Appendix B Compliance Information, page 82 of this manual and in the Appendix E Technical Specifications, page 92 -- in-
cluding, but not limited to, the Medical Device Standard (Class 1/Type B). Nevertheless, in order to ensure safe operation of
your Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device, there are a few safety warnings to bear in mind:

           No modification of this equipment is allowed

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is not to be used as a life supporting Device, and it shall not be relied on in case of loss
           of function due to power loss or other causes.

           There could be a choking hazard risk if small parts detach from the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device.

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device shall not be exposed to or used in heavy rain or weather conditions outside the
           Technical Specification of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device.

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device shall only be used with Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ specific Accessories that have a
           mounting instruction included with the accessory.

           Young children or people with cognitive disabilities should not have access to, or the use of, the
           Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device without parental or guardian supervision.

           Do no attach any decorations, post it notes or similar on the screen side of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device, that
           may interfere with the Gaze Interaction or touch screen performance.

2.1 Avoiding Hearing Damage

           Permanent hearing loss may occur if earphones, headphones or speakers are used at high volume. To prevent this,
           the volume should be set to a safe level. You can become desensitized over time to high sound levels which may then
           sound acceptable yet still could be damaging your hearing. If you experience symptoms such as ringing in your ears,
           please lower the volume or stop using the earphones/headphones. The louder the volume, the less time is required
           before your hearing could be affected.
       Hearing experts suggest the following measures to protect your hearing:
           · Limit the amount of time you use earphones or headphones at high volume.
           · Avoid turning up the volume to block out noisy surroundings.
           · Turn the volume down if you cannot hear people speaking near you.
       To establish a safe volume level:
           · Set your volume control at a low setting.
           · Slowly increase the sound until you can hear it comfortably and clearly, without distortion.

2.2 Temperature

           This device can be made to operate in two different modes, Portable and Mounted. When the device is in Mounted
           mode it is allowed to run at a higher temperature; it sets the maximum allowable environmental temperature to its high-
           est level. The risk with running the device in this mode is that it can reach temperatures in which prolonged use with
           direct skin contact may cause permanent bodily harm. Portable mode sets the maximum device temperature shut
           down limit to a lower temperature, reducing the risk for permanent bodily harm caused by prolonged exposure to the
           skin. Only choose Mounted mode when the device is mounted on a wheelchair, table, etc, with a proper mounting
           system.

12 2 Safety  Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US
           Due to use in direct sunshine or in any other hot environment the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device may have hot surfa-
           ces. There is a built in temperature sensor that monitors the temperature. If the sensor detects temperatures above
           the temperature specified in Table D.1 Maximum Allowed Temperature, page 91 for portable mode and mounted
           mode the device will automatically trigger a Windows Shut Down or Hibernate (depending on Windows Power But-
           ton configuration) to not cause the User any risk of harm. It may take a while before Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device
           can be restarted as the unit may first need time to cool down.

2.3 Power Supply and Batteries

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device uses Lithium Ion batteries. These batteries have a storage temperature range of
           between -20 /-4  and 40 /104  within 6 months.
           If you are in a hot environment, be aware that it can affect the ability to charge the batteries. The internal temperature
           has to be between 0 /32  and 45 /113  for the batteries to charge. If the internal battery temperature raises
           above 45 /113  the batteries will not charge at all.
           Move the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device and the batteries to a cooler environment to let the batteries charge
           properly.

           Avoid exposing the batteries to fire or to temperatures above 50 /122 . These conditions may cause a battery to
           malfunction, generate heat, ignite or explode. Be aware that it is possible, in a worst case scenario, for temperatures
           to reach greater than those stated above in, for example, the trunk of a car on a hot day. So, storing the device, with
           batteries installed, in a hot car trunk could conceivably lead to a malfunction.

           Do not disassemble or harm the battery. Pay attention to the environmental laws and regulations which apply in your
           area when disposing of batteries.

           For safe operation of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device, use only charger, batteries and accessories approved by
           Tobii Technology.

           Do not open, or modify, the metal casing of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device or of the power supply, since you may
           be exposed to potentially hazardous electrical voltage. The device contains no serviceable parts. If the
           Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device or it's accessories are mechanically damaged, do not to use them.

           If the batteries are not charged or the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is not powered up by the power supply, the
           Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device will shut down.

           If the Power Supply Cord is damaged, replaceable by Service Personnel only

           Do not connect any devices with a non-medical grade power supply to any connector on the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+
           device.

           The appliance coupler of the power supply or separable plug is used as the Mains Disconnection Device, please do
           not to position the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device so that it is difficult to operate the disconnection device.

           Special regulations apply to shipping Lithium-ion batteries. If dropped, crushed, or short-circuited, these batteries
           can release dangerous amounts of heat and may ignite, and are dangerous in fires.
           Please reference IATA regulations when shipping lithium metal or lithium ion batteries or cells: http://www.iata.org/
           whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/Pages/lithium_batteries.aspx

2.4 Mounting

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ should be mounted according to MANUFACTURER instructions of approved mounts.
           Tobii Dynavox or its agents are not liable for damage or injuries to a person or its property due to a
           Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ falling from a mounted configuration. The mounting of a Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is done en-
           tirely at the user's own risk.

Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US  2 Safety 13
2.5 Emergency

           Do not rely on the device for emergency calls or banking transactions. We recommend having multiple ways to com-
           municate in emergency situations. Banking transactions should only be carried out with a system recommended by,
           and approved according to the standards of, your bank.

2.6  Infrared

     The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ emits pulsed infrared (IR) light both from the eye tracker and from the Environmental
     Control Unit. Other devices controlled by IR or susceptible to disturbance by IR light might be affected by the IR light
     emitted from the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+. Do not use the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ in the vicinity of such devices if
     their functionality is of critical importance.

2.7 Epilepsy

           Some people with Photosensitive Epilepsy are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when ex-
           posed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. This may happen even if the person has no medical
           history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures.

           A person with Photosensitive Epilepsy would also be likely to have problems with TV screens, some arcade games,
           and flickering fluorescent bulbs. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain images or patterns on a mon-
           itor, or even when exposed to the light sources of an eye tracker. It is estimated that about 3-5% of people with epi-
           lepsy have this type of Photosensitive Epilepsy. Many people with Photosensitive Epilepsy experience an "aura" or
           feel odd sensations before the seizure occurs. If you feel odd during use, move your eyes away from the eye tracker.

2.8 Electricity

           Do not open the casing of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device, since you may be exposed to potentially hazardous
           electrical voltage. The device contains no serviceable parts.

2.9 Child Safety

           The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ are advanced computer systems and electronic devices. As such they are composed of
           numerous separate, assembled parts. In the hands of a child certain of these parts have the possibility of being sepa-
           rated from the device, possibly constituting a choking hazard or another danger to the child.

           Young children should not have access to, or the use of, the device without parental or guardian supervision.

2.10 Environmental Control

           The GEWA Programmable IR Remote Control -- Environmental Control Unit (ECU) is not to be relied on as the only
           method of interaction with IR controlled devices.

2.11 Gaze Interaction

           Some people may experience a certain amount of fatigue (due to intentional eye focusing and hard concentration) or
           even a dryness of the eyes (due to less frequent blinking) when first getting used to Gaze Interaction. If you are experi-
           encing fatigue or dry eyes start off slowly and limit the length of your Gaze Interaction sessions to your comfort level.
           Remoisturizing eye drops can be helpful to combat dryness.

4 Batteries in the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+

4.1 Batteries

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device has two battery compartments. The batteries are of the same size and capacity for both the
Tobii Dynavox I­12+ and I­15+, see Appendix E Technical Specifications, page 92.

                                             Figure 4.1 Battery with Indicator for Remaining Capacity

4.1.1 Hot Swappable

You can remove/replace one battery without switching off the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device, providing that the remaining bat-
tery is sufficiently charged. The remaining battery requires being at least ~10% charged to maintain device operation.

           Please allow the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device a few seconds to detect the newly inserted battery before removing
           the other battery.

4.2 Charging

The batteries shall only be charged using the included adapter, or by using theI-Series Table Charger (not included, separate
purchase required). When the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device is shut down and the adapter is plugged in, the charging of com-
pletely discharged batteries may take up to 5 hours. The device can be used while the batteries are being charged, though this
may affect the time a battery takes to reach full capacity.

           To be sure that charging takes place in both the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device and when using the I-Series Table
           Charger, be sure to plug the adaptor into both the wall socket and the device or Charger BEFORE you insert the
           batteries.

           The batteries will only charge when its capacity is 95% or lower.

The expected battery lifetime is 500 charge/discharge cycles. After that, the capacity of the battery will decrease by about 20%
in usage time.
For battery storage and charging temperatures, see 2 Safety, page 12 .

4.2.1 Checking Charge Level

Click on the battery icon,  , in the Notification area to see the remaining charge of the battery, which is installed in the
device.

You may also, at any time, check the status of a battery by pressing the indicator button on the face of the battery. Five LEDs
(light-emitting diodes) will indicate the remaining charge level. For example, three lit LEDs indicate a 60% remaining charge,
see Figure 4.1 Battery with Indicator for Remaining Capacity, page 22.
When charging, the highest capacity LED indicator will be blinking.

           The lowest capacity LED indicator (the "20" LED), will also blink when the indicator button is pressed if the battery's
           capacity has dropped below 10%. So don't rely upon the blinking of the 20% indicator as a guarantee for charging.

           If the batteries have been deeply discharged (this can happen by leaving an empty battery inserted in the
           Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device without the power adapter connected) you may not see any indication of charging
           when you reconnect the adapter properly to the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device or the Table Charger. It may take
           some time (even up to 20 minutes) before you see an LED indication that any charging is taking place. The battery IS
           being charged during this duration though it is a recovery charge raising the level enough to begin normal charging.

4.3 Inserting and Releasing the Batteries

For safety reasons, the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device is delivered without the batteries inserted. The batteries are delivered
only partially charged. The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device can be used right away. It is nevertheless recommended that the bat-
teries are charged for at least two hours before using the device.

4.3.1 Inserting the Batteries

To insert the batteries:
   1. Insert a battery in the battery compartment.
   2. Press the battery until it locks in place. You should hear a click that confirms that the battery is in a locked place.

5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+

No skill other then reading is necessary for setting up the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device. Follow this User´s Manual and the
Quick Start Manual.

5.1 Starting the Device

Start the device in one of the following ways:
   · Press the power button on the right side of the device. (Position 9 in Figure 3.2 Bottom, Left and Right Side, page 17)
   · Activate a configured Switch (see 6.3 Switches).

When you have started the device, the Power LED will shine blue or green depending on if the device is connected to AC or on
batteries. For more information about the LED Behavior, see Appendix C Computer Device States of Operation, page 89.

5.1.1 Password Information

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device is configured to start up, using the operating system present, without a password. Though
unusual, there are situations in which the password window could plausibly pop up; for example, when creating a new user in
the operating system, when returning from the operating system's sleep mode or when downloading software updates from the
internet.

           Creating a new windows user and downloading updates from the internet could possibly compromise the system and
           software settings of the operating system that have been set and installed at Tobii Technology.

Should the password window pop up, requiring a password, the default password on all Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ devices is, "Is-
eries" (case sensitive). In order to type in the password use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard or an external USB keyboard
(not included).
If you decide to change the password, be sure to write it down in a safe place for later use.
Suggested place to keep new password: ________________________
Without the operating system's access password, Tobii Dynavox Support may be unable to assist you with any future
difficulties.

5.1.2 Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ Welcome Guide

When you start your Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ Device for the first time you will be greeted by the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ Wel-
come Guide. The guide is a setup wizard that will walk you through some steps that will help you make the most of your device.
Follow the instructions and select on Next to get to the next page of the Guide.

5.2 Shutting Down the Device

The device should be shut down using one of the following ways:
   · Use the start menu in Windows (recommended when possible).
   · Press a configured Switch for two to seven seconds.

                    Pressing the Switch for more than 7 seconds will shut down the device immediately, disregarding any unsaved
                    changes.

   · Through the communication software installed on the device
Should you be unable to shut the device down using either of the above, you can hold the power button on the right side of the
device down for seven seconds. The device will consequently shut down immediately, without waiting for open applications to
close.

           This will not work if the side buttons have been disabled in the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ Control Center. For more in-
           formation, see 6.1.2 Disable All Buttons, page 49.

Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US  5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ 25
           This is not considered a "clean" Windows shut down and is thus not recommended unless completely necessary.

5.3 Using Gaze Interaction

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ operate with precision regardless of glasses, contact lenses, eye color or light conditions.
Gaze Interaction enables you to control the computer with your eyes using either Gaze Enabled applications (like
Tobii Dynavox Communicator /Tobii DynaVox Compass) or through the two types of Windows Control. See 5.4.1 Windows
Control Type, page 28.

5.3.1 Positioning

                                                                   Figure 5.1 Positioning
The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is designed to work optimally when it is parallel to the user's eyes at a distance of about 60 cm
(23.5 inches), see Figure 5.1 Positioning, page 26.

                                 Figure 5.2 Positioning when Users Leaning Sideways or Those Lying Down

This means that for those users leaning sideways or those lying down the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ also needs to be tilted in or-
der to keep the users eyes parallel to the screen and at the optimal distance, see Figure 5.2 Positioning when Users Leaning
Sideways or Those Lying Down, page 26.

           Make sure the user is placed comfortably in relation to the optimal positioning of, and distance from, the unit. Be
           aware also that the user's comfort, as well as the Gaze Interaction performance, will be enhanced if the sun is not
           shining directly on the screen or into the user's eyes.

The user should be positioned at the optimal distance to allow for the best possible Gaze Interaction.

5.3.2 Track Box

The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ allows for extensive Freedom of Head Movement. Once the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is properly
calibrated and placed in front of the user, no further adjustments are required.
The Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ produces an industry leading sized track box with the approximate dimensions of 30 cm × 20 cm
× 20 cm / 11.8 in × 7.9 in × 7.9 in (Width × Height × Depth). The Track Box is an invisible box positioned approximately 60
cm (23.5 in) straight out from a point just above the middle of the screen.

26 5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+  Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US
At 70 cm (27.5 in) the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ allows for lateral Freedom of Head Movement in an area of about 50 × 36 cm
(20 × 14 in).
In order to function properly for Gaze Interaction the user needs at least one eye in the track box at all times.

5.3.3 Track Status Viewer

Use the Track Status viewer (see 5.3.3.1 Showing Track Status , page 27 for more information on how to open the Track Status
viewer) to help determine the optimal height and horizontal positioning for Gaze Interaction with the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+.

   · Ideally, the two dots that represent the user's eyes should be in the middle of the Track Status viewer.
   · Use the distance meter on the right hand side of the Track Status viewer to determine the optimal distance the user

         should be from the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+.
   · The white triangle in the distance meter should hover near the center, within the green, when the optimal distance from

         the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ is reached.

           For information about calibration of the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ see 7.2 Calibration, page 64. Also check the lighting
           conditions, related to what is mentioned above, when calibrating.

5.3.3.1 Showing Track Status

The track status viewer is a window/dialog where you can verify that the Gaze Interaction recognizes your eyes and that you are
well positioned in front of the device.

Open the track status viewer in one of the following ways:

   · Open Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings > Calibration and select the Track status button.
   · Right-click (long-hold finger on icon for touch screen right clicking) on the Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings

icon,  , in the Notification area and select Show track status.

5.3.4 Positioning Guide

For extra assistance in positioning, there is a Positioning guide that will show itself automatically in the bottom-right corner of
your monitor.

The Positioning guide is a visual guide that combines the function of the Track Status viewer with six different image based
instructions to help the user with correct positioning.

Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US              5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ 27
The 6 instructions direct the user to:
   1. Move head down.
   2. Move head up.
   3. Move head to the right.
   4. Move head to the left.
   5. Move head closer to the monitor.
   6. Move head farther away from the monitor.

Move head closer to the monitor.                Move head to the right.

The Positioning guide will automatically disappear when the user's positioning is improved in the way that is directed by the
guide.

Some users may not want the Positioning guide to pop up every time their eyes leave optimal positioning.

To turn On or Off the automatic Positioning guide, see 7.6 System Settings, page 72

5.4 Using Windows Control

Windows Control allows you to access the desktop and all applications of your Windows computer with Gaze Interaction.

5.4.1 Windows Control Type

Windows Control can be used in two different modes

   · Gaze Selection
         Gaze Selection is a very precise and fast input method that allows you advanced Windows access but with a simple to
         use interface. No accidental clicks, no unintentional mouse pointer movements. You can relaxed gaze around at your
         Windows desktop, your software application, web page or movie, when you have decided what action you want to take
         next, you select your tool of choice from the toolbar and look back at the target area to make your selection.

         Gaze Selection is ideal for normal to advanced Windows access where you want the full accessibility to control basically
         any Windows software without the need for fast decisions and movements. It can be controlled using either Gaze (dwell)
         or switch activation method for even more control and speed.

   · Mouse Emulation

28 5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+          Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US
         Mouse Emulation gives you full control of your mouse pointer, just like you would do with a physical mouse input device.
         You can left click, right click, double click, zoom, scroll and much more. You basically can control any Windows software
         that works with mouse clicks. With some practice you could achieve as high precision as with any other mouse pointer
         device. Mouse Emulation is ideal for emergent (sensory) to advanced Windows usage and for software which teaches
         the usage of eyegaze. You can hide the Mouse Emulation menu if you want to limit the functionality or avoid distraction
         by pressing the F2 button on your keyboard.

         See http://www.tobiidynavox.com/explore/games-activities/ for ideas on some of the software and games used with
         Mouse Emulation.

To select which type of Windows Control you wish to use and to customize Windows Control:

   · Open Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings > Windows Control, see 7.5 Windows Control, page 70
   · Select your preferred type of Windows Control under Windows Control Type

5.4.2 Starting and Disabling Windows Control

To start Windows Control, right-click on the Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings icon,    , in the Notification area
and select Enable Windows Control.

Or                                                            , This will immediately start Windows Control.
Double-click on the Windows Control shortcut on the desktop,

To disable Windows Control, right-click on the Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings icon,  , in the Notification
area and select Disable Windows Control.

You can also start Windows Control from Tobii Dynavox Communicator /Tobii DynaVox Compass or alternative communication
software, which has implemented the functions provided by the Tobii Dynavox Eye Control SDK 2

Auto start

· Open Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Settings > Windows Control.
· Check the Auto start Windows control at boot check box if you want Windows Control to auto start when the

     Tobii Dynavox Gaze Interaction Software starts.

5.4.3 Using Gaze Selection

The Gaze Selection mode of Windows Control makes it possible for the user to control a standard Windows desktop operating
system with a two step selection method which reduces the risks of unwanted clicks. It also prevents the following of the mouse
cursor with your gaze as opposed to the controlling of it (there is no floating mouse cursor in Gaze Selection).

   1. The first step is to select the desired Task from the docked Taskbar by looking at it.

   2. The second step is to look at the desired portion of the screen (or icon on the screen) where you want to execute the
         Task. An automatic zoom function is enabled, ending in the selection of the icon or execution of the task.

           All functions in Gaze Selection are Touch and Mouse enabled which makes it easier for a Caregiver or Assistant to
           help the user if needed. The Caregiver or Assistant can select a Function/Task or change the settings for the user
           much easier.

5.4.3.1 Gaze Selection Taskbar

At the top of the Gaze Selection Taskbar there is a Track Status viewer. It allows you to verify that the eye tracker recognizes
your eyes and that you are well positioned in front of the device.

The Task Buttons in the Gaze Selection Taskbar can be in three different modes as shown in Figure 5.3 The Modes for the
Gaze Selection Taskbar, page 30.

Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US           5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ 29
· Normal (Unselected) - No Task Button for Gaze Selection is chosen.
· Primary Selection (Blue/black) - The marked Task Button is selected and the Task will be executed after the auto-

     matic zoom when the user looks at the desired position on the screen or icon on it. If the selection method is set to
     Switch in the Gaze Selection Settings Dialog, the chosen Task Button will still remain active after executing the Task.

                 The Functions Overlay Task will not perform any zooming. When selecting Functions Overlay with Primary Se-
                 lection, the Functions Areas/Commands will be active but not visible.

· Secondary Selection (Blue/white) - Same as Primary Selection but with a higher precision. Primary Selection
     means that the zoom will progress deeper before the final execution of the Task, making the desired portion of the
     screen bigger and easier to select within. Activate this mode by resting your gaze on the Task Button until the color
     changes according to the image below.

                 The Functions Overlay Task will not perform any zooming. When selecting Functions Overlay with Secondary
                 Selection, the Functions will be active and the areas of each Function will be visible to the user.

       The Functions Overlay will not perform any zoom, some other tasks won't either in some situations (scroll, settings,
       keyboard).

5.4.3.3 Functions Overlay in Windows 8

Windows 8 Gaze Selection is a revolutionary new method of Gaze Interaction. It is expressly created for the modern and intui-
tive touch enabled environment of tablets, as well for maximizing and enhancing the complete Gaze Interaction experience of ul-
trabooks, laptops, and desktop PCs.

Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ User's manual v.1.4 - en-US  5 Using the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ 31
It is created as a wholistic, full OS control, Gaze Interaction solution; enabling fully hands-free control of your Windows 8 OS.
From emulated touch gestures, click types, taps and side swipes, to Charms and split screen Snapping. From real "Gaze-on/
Hands-off" multitasking to true access and control of all available legacy or current Desktop applications and settings.

Windows 8 Gaze Selection opens the tens of thousands of the current, social, professional, entertaining and educational Win-
dows 8 Modern Apps to Eye Controlled use.

Built around making use of the intuitive power of Microsoft's new touch-centric interface for Windows 8 touch screen devices,
the new Gaze Selection brings hands free use into the modern consumer computer environment.

While it is centrally built around fully hands-free use cases, Gaze Selection is also made for even faster access with Switches,
as well as being completely touch (and mouse) enabled for multimodal input and third party assistance.

When selecting the Functions Overlay with Primary Selection, the Functions Areas/Commands will be active but not visible.

When selecting the Functions Overlay with Secondary Selection, the Functions will be active and the areas of each Function
will be visible to the user.

           The Functions Overlay will not perform any zoom.

5.4.3.4.1  How to Snap Window/Close App

The Snap Window feature in Window 8.1 makes it possible to split and divide the screen to be able to run two to four Modern
Apps at the same time. This feature is limited to the resolution of screen of the device, see Table 5.1 Number of Apps on Screen
Windows 8.1, page 33 for information on how many Apps are possible to run on which screen resolution in Windows 8.. The
lowest resolution needed to be able to Snap Windows is 1024×768 (Windows 8.1)

5.4.3.4.2   To Snap More Apps

To be able to Snap more than two Apps on the screen, the                 (Drag and Drop) Task from the Taskbar must be used, see

Table 5.1 Number of Apps on Screen Windows 8.1, page 33 for more information about how many Apps can be visible at the

same time on the screen. With the                    (Drag & Drop) it is possible to customize the width of each Snap area also.

5.4.3.5 Selection Methods -- Gaze and Switch

There are two methods to execute the chosen Task. The method of choice is set from within the Gaze Selection Settings Dialog,
see 8 Gaze Selection Settings, page 75.

Before executing a selection you select a Task from the Taskbar to execute. Gaze at your chosen task until it is highlighted as
"Primary" or "Secondary Selection".

   · Gaze - To execute the chosen Task, rest your gaze at the desired portion of the screen (or icon on the screen) where
         you want to execute the Task. An automatic zoom function is enabled, ending in the selection of the icon or execution of
         the task.

   · Switch - Two different execution modes.

         ­ Single activation of the Switch - the zoom function will execute in the same way as with the Gaze method and
               according to the settings made in the Gaze Selection Settings Dialog, see 8 Gaze Selection Settings, page 75.

         ­ Activate and hold the Switch - the zoom function will zoom continuously and end only upon the release / deacti-
               vation of the switch.

           The Functions Overlay will not perform any zoom.

           When using the Gaze method, you have to look back to the Taskbar to select a new Task after the execution of the
           Task, even if it is the same as you have just used.

           When precision is set to zero in Gaze Selection Settings - no zoom is performed. For more information, see 8 Gaze
           Selection Settings, page 75.

5.4.3.5.1  Sticky Tasks & Default Left Click / Tap for Switch

When using the Switch method, a feature is made use of called "sticky tasks". If a Task becomes "sticky" it means that you do
not have to look back at the Taskbar if you want to repeat the execution of the selected Task, only if you want to change the Task
to another.

When using the Switch method, the Left Click / Tap Task is "sticky" by default. This means that Left Click / Tap is always on
and will always be activated by the activation of the switch, if nothing else is selected. If another Task is selected it will be active
only once (for one selection) and then Gaze Selection will automatically default back to Left Click / Tap for the subsequent
selections.

The exception to this is the Double Click Task; when it is selected when using Switch mode it will also become sticky, meaning
that it will stay selected until another Task is selected (after which it will again default back to Left Click / Tap).

This allows for excellent use cases such as quick/continual surfing of the internet by activating the Switch and thus the Left
Click / Tap Task once and then repeatedly selecting anything desired, without having to choose the Left Click /Tap Task again
multiple times.

5.4.3.5.2  Activating a Task with a Keyboard button instead of a Switch

Selecting the "F12 Keyboard Button",    , on an attached keyboard will activate a Task selection. It can be used in exactly

the same way as a connected switch. For more information on Switches, see 5.4.3.5 Selection Methods -- Gaze and Switch,

page 37.

5.4.3.6 Gaze Keyboard

By selecting the Gaze Keyboard button on the Taskbar, the Gaze Keyboard will launch as an on-screen keyboard. The Gaze
Keyboard will be positioned either at the top or at the bottom of the screen depending on where the user choose to place it.

The keyboard can be placed on the screen in two different ways with the Primary and Secondary selection of the keyboard task:

   · With Primary selection:

             1. Activate the Primary Selection of the keyboard task.

             2. Select where to write and the keyboard will be launch at the opposite side.
                   If you want to write in the lower part of the screen, the keyboard will be placed at the top and vise versa.

                              With dwell usage the keyboard will be placed opposite to where you dwell immediately. If the user is
                              using a switch, the user must first gaze where to type and then hit the switch to place the keyboard in
                              the opposite place.

   · With Secondary selection:

         ­ The keyboard will be placed at the bottom of the screen automatically.

Together with the Gaze Keyboard, the Keyboard Taskbar will be launched. For more information, see 5.4.3.6.1 Keyboard Task-
bar, page 39.

The Gaze Keyboard consists of four keyboard pages in a rotating loop. The user can easily switch between the different key-
board pages by selecting the next page buttons located to the far left and right on all pages of the Gaze Keyboard.

The key on the keyboard where the user is gazing will be indicated by a light frame around the character/function  on the
key.

The four keyboard pages are:

           The Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Win and Alt Gr keys will become "sticky" once selected. This means that they will stay selected un-
           til the user selects a new key from the keyboard. They will stay sticky if the next selected key is another sticky key.

           To write a letter with an accent:
           1. Select the accent
           2. Select the character
           3. The character will appear with the chosen accent.

5.4.3.6.1  Keyboard Taskbar

At the top of the Keyboard Taskbar there is a Track Status viewer the same way as in the Gaze Selection Taskbar. It allows you
to verify that the eye tracker recognizes your eyes and that you are well positioned in front of the device.

The Task Buttons in the Keyboard Taskbar can be in three different modes as shown in Figure 5.12 The Modes for the Key-
board Taskbar, page 40.

· Normal (Unselected) - No Task Button for Gaze Selection is chosen.
· Primary Selection (Blue/black) - The marked Task Button is selected and the Task will be executed after the auto-

     matic zoom when the user looks at the desired position on the screen or icon on it. If the selection method is set to
     Switch in the Gaze Selection Settings Dialog, the chosen Task Button will still remain active after executing the Task.
· Secondary Selection(Blue/white) - Same as Primary Selection but with a higher precision. Primary Selection
     means that the zoom will progress deeper before the final execution of the Task, making the desired portion of the
     screen bigger and easier to select within. Activate this mode by resting your gaze on the Task Button until the color
     changes according to the image below.

           Only available for the Left Click function

                                                Task that closes the keyboard.

5.4.3.6.3    Word Prediction

The word prediction engine that is used in Gaze Selection is from SwiftKey and is commonly used in tablets and smartphones.
SwiftKey uses a blend of artificial intelligence technologies that enable it to predict the next word the user intends to type. Swift-
Key learns from previous text the user has written and output predictions based on currently input text and what it has learned.
The Word Prediction language will change depending on the Keyboard Language setting.

                                               Figure 5.13 Keyboard with Word Prediction Activated

When Word Prediction is in use, see 8 Gaze Selection Settings, page 75 for more information about activating/deactivating
Word Prediction, six (6) boxes will appear above the Keyboard. The leftmost box will display the most probable predicted word
and the remaining five (5) boxes will contain one predicted word each. To select a predicted word, just select the box with the
correct word in it. If you can't find the word you are looking for, just keep on typing and hopefully the word you are looking for will
appear after the next character.

If you are using Word Prediction and want to type a word containing an accent, like café, you are often better off let-
ting Word Prediction handle the accent. Simply type "cafe" and you will get a suggestion for "café".

Typing the accent manually with Word Prediction might give strange looks on the prediction buttons, but the result
should come out alright in the document you are typing to.

While the user is typing, the last 5-10 characters will be displayed in blue on the indicated/highlighted key. For more informa-
tion, see 8 Gaze Selection Settings, page 75. This feature assists the user in easily spotting misspellings and reduces the need
for looking at the actual spot where the text is inserted, thus increasing typing speed.

7.2.4 Improving Calibration Point(s)

After calibration, you may want to improve one or more points.
There is a color scheme used that will help you to understand the quality of your calibration.

           All three color statuses are the result of a successful calibration.

· If the background color of the Calibration Result is light red, you have achieved a successful, but relatively low quality
     calibration. You can improve one or more points individually, or recalibrate completely, to achieve better
     Gaze Interaction results.

                 Improving even one (or more) of the calibrations points can significantly improve the calibration.

   · If the background color of the Calibration Result is light yellow, you have achieved successful and good quality calibra-
         tion. You might be able achieve better Gaze Interaction results by improving one or more points individually.

   · If the background color of the Calibration Result is green, you have achieved a successful and high quality calibration.

           Be aware that no matter what quality of calibration you have achieved you will be able to select OK or Apply and be-
           gin using Gaze Interaction. It is the accuracy and functionality of the Gaze Interaction that is affected by the quality of
           the calibration results. Try for the best calibration possible.

           Remember! In the end it is the personal experience that counts!

The closer the lines within the calibration point are to a dot in the center of the circle of the calibration point, the better the cali-

bration is of that point,  .You can choose the points to be improved and calibrate only those points again.

To improve one or more calibration points, follow these steps :

1. Open Gaze Interaction Settings > Calibration.

2. Select the point(s) you want to improve under Calibration Result.

3. Select the Improve Point(s) button and a calibration for the selected point(s) will start.

7.2.5 Removing Calibration Point(s)

If there is a calibration point that is consistently bad after calibration (the green lines are scattered all around and outside the
circle of the calibration point) you can remove that point completely from the calibration, this may improve the calibration of the
other points. Be aware that if you remove a point, that area of the screen will be uncalibrated and Gaze Interaction will not func-
tion properly there.
To remove one or more calibration points, follow these steps:

   1. Open Gaze Interaction Settings > Calibration.

NOTE 1 At 80 MHz and 800 MHz, the higher frequency range applies.

NOTE 2 These guidelines may not apply in all situations. Electromagnetic propagation is affected by absorption and
reflected from structures, objects and people.

i. Field strengths from fixed transmitters, such as base stations for radio (cellular/cordless) telephones and land mobile radios, amateur radio, AM and
       FM radio broadcast and TV broadcast cannot be predicted theoretically with accuracy. To assess the electromagnetic environment due to fixed RF
       transmitters, an electromagnetic site survey should be considered. If the measured field strength in the location in which the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+
       device is used exceeds the applicable RF compliance level above, the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device should be observed to verify normal operation. If
       abnormal performance is observed, additional measures may be necessary, such as reorienting or relocating the Tobii Dynavox I-Series+ device.

ii. Over the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz, field strengths should be less than 3 V/m.

i. Freedom of head movement describes the volume in front of the tracker in which the user must have at least one of the eyes. The numbers are
       specified parallell/orthogonal to screen surface, assuming eye tracker is at 20 degree angle to screen.

ii. Gaze accuracy describes the angular average distance from the actual gaze point to the one measured by the eye tracker.
       Accuracy under ideal conditions is measured with users placed in the center of the eye tracker track box with the head resting on a chin rest, and the
       room and screen illumination constant at 300 lux.

       Accuracy across head box is measured with users after calibration systematically positioned at varying positions ranging from center of the head box
       up to +/- 15 cm horizontal, +/- 10 cm vertical and +/- 10 cm distance.

       Accuracy across varying background illumination is measured with users' head resting on a chin rest, and after calibration modifying background
       illumination from 1 to 1000 lux.

iii. Gaze Precision describes the point-to-point variation between individual gaze samples (here specified with binocular data, ie both eyes, and
       measured on artificial eyes). Gaze Precision with Stampe filter is with Stampe stage 2 noise-reduction algorithm applied to raw data (Stampe ,
       Behavior Research Methods, Instruments & Computers 1993, 25 (2), 137-142).
       Precision without filter is based on raw data, without any de-noising filter applied, either inside or outside the eye tracker.

       Precision under ideal conditions is measured with users placed in the center of the eye tracker track box with the head resting on a chin rest, and the
       room and screen illumination constant at 300 lux.

       Precision across head box is measured with users after calibration systematically positioned at varying positions ranging from center of the head box
       up to +/- 15 cm horizontal, +/- 10 cm vertical and +/- 10 cm distance.
