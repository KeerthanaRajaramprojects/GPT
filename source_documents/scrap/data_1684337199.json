And spoiler alert\u2014we may be thinking about the difference between articulation vs. phonological disorders all wrong.\u00a0 August 13, 2022 Download This review was updated from the original version in August 2022. We made a correction to the research linked under the complexity approach. \u00a0 Speech sound disorders. It\u2019s one of those things our relatives who don\u2019t really understand what we do assume is the only thing we do. It\u2019s one of the areas of practice our field was founded on, and one where we\u2019re fortunate to have an array of treatment approaches (like, dozens) backed up by decades of research, for both phonological and articulation disorders. All these evidence-based options can be a challenge to navigate, though, and choosing the right approach could mean the difference between a child meeting their goals and \u201cgraduating\u201d from speech and that same child staying on the caseload for years. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve put together this Ask TISLP: to give you a starting point for making informed treatment decisions. To narrow things down, we\u2019ll be focusing only on idiopathic (traditionally called \u201cfunctional\u201d) SSDs\u2014those rooted in articulation and/or phonology and without a known cause. That means that we\u2019re not talking motor speech (CAS & dysarthria), or speech disorders related to cleft/craniofacial conditions or to hearing differences. But never fear! You can search all of those topics using the filters in our database to find reviews on supporting speech for those kiddos.\u00a0 \u00a0 Here\u2019s what to expect:\u00a0 Before you ask\u2014yes, there\u2019s a cheat sheet. Grab our downloadable chart of treatment approaches here, but don\u2019t skip the discussion, ok? Context matters. Let\u2019s get this party started! \u00a0 \u00a0 We make a distinction between articulation and phonologically based errors because we need to address them differently and because the phonology side of things has had a tendency to get overlooked.\u00a0 \u00a0 Articulation errors are motor-based\u2014there\u2019s a breakdown in the movement of the articulators, so our therapy for articulation errors focuses on accurate placement and movement of the tongue, lips, teeth, etc.\u00a0 \u00a0 Phonological errors, on the other hand, are language-based, meaning that the child has incorrect or fuzzy mental representations of the speech sounds. Let\u2019s break that one down a bit. When we learn the phonology of a language, our brains learn the rules for which qualities of sounds are phonemic and important for meaning (like the final voicing difference in /b\u00e6k/ vs /b\u00e6g/), and which aren\u2019t. For example, the aspirated /p/ in \u201cpin\u201d and the unaspirated one in \u201cspin\u201d both fit in our same mental category of English /p/\u2014although the same wouldn\u2019t be true for every language! A child with phonological errors may have internalized the \u201cwrong\u201d rules\u2014like disregarding the manner difference between /s/ and /t/ and storing them in the same mental category. This might surface as a consistent stopping error. Fuzzy phonological representations happen when kids are still learning to make sense of the rules, like the fact that fricatives are long and noisy and stops are short, so they aren\u2019t able to clearly and consistently distinguish fricatives from stops. This might show up as inconsistent errors. When you start looking, phonology is everywhere: even single-sound errors might show up phonologically in a child\u2019s decoding and spelling. Therefore, phonological therapy needs to help the child internalize the correct phonological rules.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Of course, in a lot of cases, articulation and phonological issues are both in the mix. Kids that have both types of errors have incorrect/fuzzy representations stored in their brains AND make motor mistakes. For example, a child who glides liquids might not have /l/ and /w/ clearly stored as different phonemes in their brain\u2014a phonological error\u2014AND might also not be able to move the tongue tip to the alveolar ridge to produce /l/\u2014the articulation error.\u00a0 \u00a0 This all means that we need to collect sufficient data in a comprehensive assessment process to find these phonological issues when they exist. You can use formal assessments (like the HAPP-3, the DEAP, or the KLPA-3), speech sampling, and/or speech perception and phonological processing tasks like those described here to help you figure out if a child's errors are articulation-based, phonological, or both, and to identify any phonological patterns in the child\u2019s errors. For an overview of comprehensive evaluations of children\u2019s speech production, check out this open-access tutorial, this one for multilingual children, or this one for single speech sound errors.\u00a0 \u00a0 After collecting all that excellent assessment data, you\u2019ll choose the best match of a treatment approach and go from there, keeping in mind that you sometimes might have to start therapy before totally \u201cfiguring out\u201d the child\u2019s working speech sound system and exactly where all the breakdowns are. That\u2019s where clinical data collection comes in! \u00a0 At a certain point, the artic/phono dichotomy outstays its welcome. We\u2019ll let Dr. Kelly Farquharson explain: \u00a0 \u201cFey (1992) noted that articulation and phonology are \u201cinextricable constructs.\u201d That is\u2014it\u2019s REALLY hard to separate them into black and white, stand-alone categories. Pennington (2006) actually refers to the terms \u201carticulation disorder\u201d and \u201cphonological disorder\u201d as what speech sound disorders were formerly called. As in, he assumed that we\u2019ve moved beyond that dichotomy a long time ago. His point, also, is that if we dichotomize it, we are making assumptions about the underlying issue that we simply can\u2019t prove\u2014said differently, how do we prove that phonological representations are \u201cfuzzy\u201d? In this paper I share a few case examples of children whose speech sound production might make you assume one diagnosis, but further data suggests otherwise. One child has a single sound error\u2014which might make one assume an articulation disorder. However, his single sound error appeared in his spelling, which speaks to fuzzy representations. The inverse was true for the child with multiple sound patterns\u2014he might appear phonological on the surface, but his phonological skills were intact otherwise.\u201d \u00a0 Let\u2019s think of articulation and phonology as two different lenses for looking at a child\u2019s speech sound errors\u2014and for assessment and treatment, we need to be wearing bifocals.\u00a0 We\u2019ve sectioned our discussion of treatment approaches by which lens they\u2019re based on, but don\u2019t let that trick you into seeing your clinical decisions as an either/or situation (more on that later).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As we take you through the different approaches, we\u2019ll briefly address the size and quality of the evidence base for each. We got a lot of this information from this 2021 textbook edited by Williams, McLeod, & McCauley, which is an excellent resource\u2014nerd-out kind of reading\u2014if you want to dive deeper. Overall, most of the evidence base for idiopathic SSD treatment is based on case studies or controlled case/cohort studies (level 2 or 3 evidence, if you use the SIGNS evidence grading system). There are some level 1 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but they\u2019re few and far in between. This makes sense, since even though RCTs are the \u201cgold standard,\u201d they\u2019re difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to carry out. So while the evidence base here is much larger and more informative than in some other areas of SLP practice, it\u2019s certainly not perfect. As always, it's important that we use our knowledge and experience to integrate the existing evidence, keeping in mind the needs of our clients/students and their families.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We\u2019ll start with an old friend: the Traditional Articulation approach, with credit to Van Riper all the way back in 1939. It was developed for children with mild articulation errors and later adapted for children with moderate-to-severe errors.\u00a0 Now chances are, this is one approach you\u2019ve got down cold. Brumbaugh and Smit (we reviewed it here) found that SLPs supporting preschoolers with SSDs use the Traditional approach most frequently (and were less familiar with phonological approaches), and Cabbage and colleagues found it made the top three approaches among school-based SLPs, too. Remember, though, that the Traditional Articulation approach is unlikely to be efficient or effective for children with phonological errors, so don\u2019t stop here!\u00a0 \u00a0 Though we\u2019ve seen some variations in the last 80-odd years, the key components of Traditional articulation therapy remain the same. It may have a bit of auditory perception tied in\u2014like asking if the sounds /g/ and /d/ or the words \u201cgate\u201d and \u201cdate\u201d are the same or different\u2014but it always mostly targets motor production. Research on motor learning principles tells us that distributed, variable practice on a large number of complex targets is more advantageous compared to mass practice on a smaller number of simple targets (to refresh your memory on motor learning principles, see Tables 1 and 2 of this paper). You can also use a horizontal approach to target attack to improve efficiency. Some modern spins to articulation therapy include using a computer program (like SATPAC, discussed in this review) or biofeedback (see here, here, and here to learn more), both of which are especially useful options for older children who have residual distortions on sounds like /\u0279/.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Stimulability Approach from Dr. Adele Miccio is another (short-term) option for addressing articulation in very young children (2\u20134 years old) who have extremely small phonetic inventories and are not yet stimulable for most consonant sounds. After stimulability improves, you can reassess and transition to a different approach as needed.\u00a0 \u00a0 We have a few more choices under this lens, and it\u2019s critical to choose carefully based on the number, type(s), and consistency of phonological errors. Remember that we\u2019re not focusing only on the movement of the articulators here. Phonological approaches also need to address the fact that errors like producing \u201ctoe\u201d for \u201cso\u201d result in differences in meaning. We put these approaches in bullet points for readability, but remember we also have the printable chart version here for easy scanning. \u00a0 For more details and a comparison of minimal pairs, maximal oppositions, and multiple oppositions (AKA the contrastive approaches), see this tutorial. For all contrastive approaches, the SCIP app from Dr. A. Lynn Williams is an excellent resource for target selection and therapy.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We know children with SSDs may be at additional risk for literacy disorders\u2014see our reviews on the relationship between SSDs and literacy here, here, and here. For kids where you suspect (or have confirmed) a literacy disorder, you can consider incorporating metaphonology in your treatment plan. This can look like targeting children\u2019s explicit awareness of sounds\u2019 distinctive features\u2014place, manner, and voicing\u2014using kid-friendly language. Some metaphonological approaches you may be familiar with include Metaphon (described by the creators here, or see the ASHA Practice Portal for a summary) and LiPS, although the evidence base for these programs is pretty limited.\u00a0 \u00a0 Integrated Phonological Awareness Intervention takes things a step further by focusing on letter-sound knowledge and phonemic awareness. Rather than indirectly support literacy skills while you\u2019re targeting speech, this approach embeds speech production practice in literacy activities, like syllable and rhyme awareness, segmenting, blending, and manipulating individual phonemes. We know of 9 studies (1 RCT) supporting IPAI for improving phonological awareness skills (many used the rules from the Cycles approach to select targets), although two studies (1 RCT), suggest that it may not be sufficient (at least not in realistic dosages) to correct speech sound errors. If you\u2019re interested, check out these free phonological awareness resources from Dr. Gail Gillon, who led much of the research on IPAI.\u00a0 \u00a0 Is your brain full? Has the word \u201capproach\u201d ceased to have any meaning? Approach\u2026 approach\u2026 aPPROach. Anyway. While these\u2026 intervention methods look nice and clear-cut on paper (like here, in our printable chart), there\u2019s a lot of clinical judgment involved in carrying them out, so let\u2019s chat about some lingering questions you may have:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Not necessarily. Let\u2019s actually put \u201cjust artic\u201d to bed, shall we? According to Farquharson, \u201cthis phrase makes the assumption that this type of communication disorder is less important and less complex than others\u201d and may cause clinicians unintentionally to restrict their treatment options. She suggests SLPs \u201cconsider approaches such as minimal pairs, even if the child has a single sound error.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you\u2019re wearing your cool artic-phono bifocals (3D glasses? Is that a cooler image?), you\u2019ll NEED to mix and match to some extent to support both of those needs. The critical piece, which has sometimes slipped through the cracks, is this: if the child has (or may have) phonological errors, we need to clean up their phonological rules, so we need to choose a treatment approach that can do this. At the same time, we can\u2019t forget to support accurate placement of the articulators. You\u2019ll be pulling therapy components and concepts (like principles of motor learning, elicitation strategies, etc.) from articulation approaches to support this need. \u00a0 But what if you have a child with a severe phonological SSD and literacy disorder on your caseload. Do you use Cycles, Maximal Oppositions, or a metaphonological approach? Unfortunately, friends, there isn\u2019t a \u201cright\u201d answer here. Trust your clinical experiences and judgment to choose what you think will work for this particular child. Then, use regular data collection and feedback from the child and their family to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy approach. Don\u2019t throw in the towel if it\u2019s \u201cnot working\u201d right away. Where we have the evidence to support it, we included details above about how long it may take to see results for a given approach. For Integrated Phonological Awareness Intervention, research suggests it may take 17\u201320 hours to see results, as compared to more like 30\u201340 hours of therapy for Cycles. If the child is not feeling the therapy, like say intense drill or even drill play = zero motivation, you may need to readjust. The child is making no progress\u2014like really, no progress\u2014you may need to readjust. We know you know therapy is a delicate balance of keeping the child motivated and making progress. Have confidence in your clinical expertise to back up your decisions! \u00a0 Also, know that we\u2019ve laid out the approaches for you as researchers originally designed and studied them. That said, there are a variety of reasons your clinical judgment might lead you to modify an approach for a specific child. Session length and frequency is one factor in particular that may be constrained by forces beyond your control. Again, you use your clinical judgment to modify the approach, but rely even more heavily on data and client perspectives to determine whether it\u2019s working. \u00a0 Finally, this list is not exhaustive. We've included the most common/popular approaches, but there are others out there! \u00a0 \u00a0 There are other options! Naturalistic approaches are an evidence-based choice for young children with co-occurring speech and language disorders, such as autistic kids and those with Down syndrome or cleft lip/palate. These approaches capitalize on children\u2019s interaction and engagement during play to facilitate speech production\u2014and they\u2019re more easily implemented by parents and caregivers than the other approaches we\u2019ve talked about. You can start with naturalistic recasting during play, which is just what it sounds like\u2014repeating the child\u2019s utterance back to them (but without the errored sound/s) in natural play activities. And if you\u2019re already doing Enhanced Milieu Teaching (EMT) or a similar approach including strategies like arranging the environment, following the child\u2019s lead, modeling, and expanding productions, you can add a phonological emphasis (EMT+PE) to simultaneously support speech and language in naturally-occurring conversations during play. Our review of a study of children with cleft palate who participated in EMT+PE lays out the core strategies for you, or you can get more detail in this article. \u00a0 \u00a0 Check out the research and resources linked above under each approach and in our downloadable chart.
