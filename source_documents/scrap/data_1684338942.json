In today\u2019s post, AAC SLPs Maggie Judson and Jeanna Antrim share ideas for language learning with the book \u2018The Skin You Live In.\u2019 Maggie and Jeanna are speech-language pathologists who work in the Assistive Technology Department for the Belleville Area Special Services Cooperative (BASSC) in southern Illinois. They are AT/AAC facilitators and provide evaluations, direct therapy, consultations, and trainings with school teams. Check out the video read-alouds using 3 different AAC apps, and their ideas for classroom activities, e-learning, supporting AAC learning at home, and more. Also, don\u2019t miss their tips for dealing with communication breakdowns. To read more about how they prepare for a TELL ME week and see resources that are based on other books take a look at their previous posts in the TELL ME About It series.  The seventh book in this new series is \u201cThe Skin You Live In\u201d by Michael Tyler.\u00a0 This book is at the top of our favorite list for So. Many. Reasons.\u00a0 The rhymes!\u00a0 The repeated phrases!\u00a0 The illustrations are perfect for a picture walk-through! And, of course, all those core words!\u00a0 Plus, it has such a lovely, empowering message that gives you all the feels and leaves you wanting to read it again and again.\u00a0 So basically, it\u2019s a perfect book to pair with TELL ME! See below for the book focus for \u201cThe Skin You Live In\u201d: Book Focus: Repeated Reading Focus: Different Media Platforms We love occasionally using different media platforms during repeated readings because it gives us that repetition with variety that we know is so important to learning. Changing up your rereadings with videos or books on tape can help to keep students engaged and interested. Just make sure any ebooks you use are not heavy on animations or games, as this can \u201cdetract from rather than add to the interactions between adults and students during shared reading (Erickson & Koppenhaver, 2020, pg. 59)\u201d. One place to quickly find different, fun versions of a book is YouTube. You can often find read-alongs with the book\u2019s author, and \u2018The Skin You Live In\u2019 is no different! Check out this great video of author Michael Tyler reading the book here. Adaptation Idea: Simplify Text Have a book you really want to use that is heavy on the text, making it overly challenging for your students to comprehend? Try adapting it by simplifying the text! You can simplify text by reducing the number of words on the page or reducing the sentences\u2019 complexity. You can write the simplified text on a sticky note or index card and attach it to the page in the book. This simple adaptation can make a book more engaging, interesting, and accessible for your students. Here are some of the different way you can simplify the text (Musselwhite & Hanser, 2018): To learn more about text simplification, check out this blog post from the AAC Girls blog here. Writing is a big part of a TELL ME classroom!\u00a0 See below for ideas:\u00a0 Predictable Chart Topic Title: I DO Lots of Things! Sentence frame: I\u2019m HAPPY when I DO ______. FUNctional Writing Activity Carryover the good vibes created from the book into your FUNctional writing this month with an AACtivity all about self-love! Use a mirror and add some symbols (we like I and MY) right to it to give your students extra visual support and support communication partners as they provide aided language input.\u00a0 Have fun looking in the mirror, saying I and MY, and then doing some writing all about what we like about ourselves.\u00a0 Looking in a mirror can be so fun and motivating for our students!  Below are some specific ideas on how to implement \u201cThe Skin You Live In\u201d in your therapy sessions and classrooms TELL ME-style! Aided Language Input Tip \u2013 Communication Breakdowns Providing aided language input is one of those instructional strategies you will find yourself doing over and over (and over!) again in a TELL ME classroom. One area that we like to provide aided language input for is how to repair communication breakdowns. We all have moments where we can\u2019t think of the exact word we want or say something that wasn\u2019t exactly what we meant. We love taking advantage of those opportunities to show our AAC users how to handle and repair communication breakdowns. One way we do this is to use the talk aloud strategy to teach our process of repairing a communication breakdown and why (e.g., \u201cOops, that was the wrong word! Let me fix that. The word I wanted to say is a place. So I am going to go to \u2018places\u2019 on my device and there is my word-YARD!\u201d). Different strategies to teach AAC users how to repair communication breakdowns: Embedding Core into the Daily Routine \u2013 Outdoor Time Outdoor time is typically a routine-based activity within the preschool classroom, making it a natural time to incorporate the target core words into different rote phrases. Having some predetermined scripts can support communication partners as they become comfortable targeting core words and providing aided language input. Some examples: Data Collection \u2013 Use Your Resources! Figuring out how to collect data that works best for you while giving you the information you need can sometimes feel challenging.\u00a0 At the beginning of each school year, we always feel like we are trying to revamp our data collection system to make it easier and more effective!\u00a0 One of our tried and true ways to feel confident and organized when it comes to data collection is to use our resources. Virtual Learning Resource \u2013 Special Education With Pat If you haven\u2019t already subscribed to the Special Education with Pat YouTube Channel, you are totally missing out! We love sharing these videos with our families and school teams, especially during remote learning periods. Their videos highlight different routines and activities in a fun, engaging way with embedded visuals! These videos are a great way to introduce, review, and get extra practice and exposure to vocabulary words and experiences you target in your classroom or therapy sessions.

TELL ME at Home \u2013 Simple Shared Reading Tip: Nonverbal Print Referencing While \u2018nonverbal print referencing\u2019 sounds like a super fancy and complicated strategy that is difficult to apply, don\u2019t let the name fool you!\u00a0 It is actually a straightforward, easy-to-use technique that will up your literacy game with little effort!\u00a0 So, what is it?\u00a0 It is simply pointing to letters, words, and other print features in the book as you read them. That\u2019s it!\u00a0 As you read, pointing to the text increases awareness of it, naturally drawing your child\u2019s eyes and attention to the print, which helps improve \u201cemergent readers\u2019 knowledge regarding the forms and features of print (Erickson & Koppenhaver, 2020, pg. 58). It is an easy-peasy technique that you will quickly feel comfortable with and that pairs perfectly with all the other shared reading strategies you are already using! Self-Reflection Tip \u2013 \u201cCore Words are Introduced or Reviewed\u201d The TELL ME program is all about helping us as educators develop good AAC teaching practices and routines that we can implement when planning other lessons. But to do this, we have to reflect on how we are providing instruction.\u00a0 Last month, we talked about using the Word Finder Feature to teach new core words and data tracking ourselves to keep tabs on the aided language input we provide. This month, reflect on those suggestions with the question \u201ccore words are introduced or reviewed\u201d from the fidelity checklists available in the TELL ME program. After reflection, would you answer this question as: If after thinking about the past month you answer this as SOMETIMES or RARELY, that\u2019s okay! We all start somewhere! We encourage you to think through what changes you can make to your teaching practices and routines to support your classroom assistants as they develop their skills to actively facilitate student learning. Because remember: self-reflection and receiving constructive feedback helps you plan for your next session and get better at providing TELL ME-style instruction! Be sure to check back next month as we work through the TELL ME manual and share activities, teaching strategies, and implementation tips for the next book in this new series, \u201cWhere\u2019s Spot?\u201d!
