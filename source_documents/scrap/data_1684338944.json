Maggie Judson and Jeanna Antrim are back with more great ideas for AAC intervention, this time focusing on the book, Come Out and Play, Little Mouse. Maggie and Jeanna are speech-language pathologists who work in the Assistive Technology Department for the Belleville Area Special Services Cooperative (BASSC) in central Illinois. They are AT/AAC facilitators and provide evaluations, direct therapy, consultations, and trainings. You can check out the earlier posts in this series below. Be sure to see their videos modeling book reading with two AAC systems toward the end of this post. TELL ME About It: AAC Learning with \u2018Come Out and Play, Little Mouse\u2019! \u00a0TELL ME About Reading: The eighth book in the TELL ME program (Teaching Early Language and Literacy through Multimodal Expression) is \u201cCome Out and Play, Little Mouse.\u201d An excellent book for introducing a simple plot line to our students, while still providing repetitive exposure to those oh-so-awesome core words.\u00a0\u00a0 Connecting the story to background knowledge is very natural for this book, as the story takes place within the home.\u00a0 Plus, there are a lot of interactions with family members and a lot of talk about chores that need to get done!\u00a0\u00a0 Another fun aspect of this book is the illustrations!\u00a0 The pictures are very colorful and detailed, which provides for a variety of communication opportunities during the picture walk-throughs and repeated readings you will be providing. See below for the rest of the book focus for \u201cCome Out and Play, Little Mouse\u201d: Book Focus: Come Out and Play, Little Mouse TELL ME About Writing: Predictable chart writing is an excellent way of providing writing instruction to our students who demonstrate emergent literacy abilities.\u00a0 The activities that are part of the process of predictable chart writing supports students to demonstrate writing and develop different concepts of print.\u00a0 And bonus! \u00a0With predictable chart writing, \u201cstudents engage more readily in the learning process because the content is personalized to their interests and experiences, and they stay engaged because every day they are doing something different with the text\u201d (Erickson, K., & Koppenhaver, D., 2020, p. 79)! Today\u2019s writing activities are described below: The focus is on participation that allows students the opportunity to practice the skill of listening for individual words in reading. To finish up this part of the lesson, use the chart to go on a core word and special letter hunt.\u00a0 As students find the targets, highlight and talk about them.\u00a0 This provides additional opportunity to practice print concepts, along with providing more core word practice.\u00a0 Hello there repeated exposure! 3. After Writing:\u00a0 To finish up the writing lesson, sing the letter song for the special letter \u2018n\u2019 and then do another movement activity!\u00a0 Today\u2019s letter activity is \u2018Letter On The Floor.\u2019\u00a0 Use masking tape to make a giant letter \u2018N\u2019 on the floor.\u00a0 Allow students to walk the tape saying, \u201cmake the letter \u2018N\u2019 with your feet!\u201d.\u00a0 Students love this activity because, again, movement!\u00a0 Pair that with how low prep it is, and we bet you will be putting this activity into heavy rotation!\u00a0  TELL ME More:\u00a0 Below are some specific ideas on how to implement \u201cCome Out and Play, Little Mouse\u201d in your therapy sessions and classrooms TELL ME-style! Story retelling is a great extension activity to work on after shared reading!\u00a0 It addresses story comprehension skills, language and communication skills, and, ultimately, a student\u2019s ability to sequence and retell events that happen in their own lives. \u201cCome Out and Play, Little Mouse\u201d is a great book to work on story retelling skills because the book has a strong plotline, with a problem and solution, and a beginning, middle, and end.\u00a0\u00a0 Students in the preschool and early childhood special education classroom may benefit from using pictures or props to work on story retelling.\u00a0 These visuals provide the necessary support to recall characters and events in the book as they sequence the plot and retell the story.\u00a0 An easy way to provide such support is with picture story props!\u00a0  Students can manipulate and organize the pictures to work on ordering the events of the story and retell the story.\u00a0 Yay for visuals! We, as adults, do not typically want to communicate, exchange information, and interact when we are not engaged, motivated, or having fun. Our students feel the same way! When we turn communication into a drill or activity to check off a schedule, it can really take the motivation out of communicating to connect. Here are some ideas to try out to up the communication temptations in the classroom! \u00a0 Who doesn\u2019t love story props?!\u00a0 Story props and toys can help students make connections to the book and support engagement and interaction during shared reading activities.\u00a0 We have pictures of characters and objects from the story velcroed on craft sticks for students to interact with during reading to help increase motivation and interest and to support comprehension.\u00a0 And as discussed earlier, they also double as visual supports during story retelling activities.\u00a0 Even better, they allow students to become a part of the story by providing them the opportunity to manipulate story elements! Also, they are fun!\u00a0 You can easily use them on repeat in lots of different, fun ways to quickly work in book learning throughout the day!\u00a0 Add them to a sensory bin.\u00a0 Hide them around the room to go on a \u201cstory elements\u201d hunt.\u00a0 Use them to create story webs on the fly.\u00a0    We can\u2019t get enough of our story props and love them so much that we have prepped a set for each book in the TELL ME series! When providing aided language input, keep in mind that when you touch a symbol on the AAC system, you want to hold the point. This gives students time to see the point, which draws attention to the word.\u00a0 And to work on eliciting a good, isolated, direct selection from our students, we need to use a steady point on the icon vs. a tapping motion. As best said by Gail Van Tatenhove, \u201cA BIG DON\u2019T when modeling is that you are not BOUNCING or TAP TAP TAPPING on the word as you model it. That can result in the student copying exactly what he sees you doing \u2013 and he may also tap tap tap or bounce bounce bounce on words when he is using the AAC system (Van Tatenhove, G & PaTTAN, module 7, slide 12).\u201d Often, we have found that we tap on the symbol as a way to try and get student attention. However, if our students then imitate that tap, it can significantly interfere with direct selection. A better way to gain attention to our aided language input is to skip the tap-tap-tap and instead just keep our finger on the symbol. So remember, hold that steady point!\u00a0  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 To read more about how we prepare for a TELL ME week, check out the initial post in the TELL ME About It series here.
