In today\u2019s post, we\u2019ve listed books that include characters with disabilities for those who may want to include those in their educational programs. The books in these lists vary in terms of their subject, target audience, and reading level. As with any book that you consider providing to children and youth, be sure to review it first to determine its appropriateness for the individual reader. Some of the books, particularly those for teens, have scenes that are intense and may contain mature content, and/or strong language. Note: If you have others that you would recommend, please reach out to us and we will update the list. Books Featuring Children & Youth with Disabilities AAC Dancing Daisies (2013)...

Today, we highlight the Literacy Instruction for Students with Significant Disabilities website, a resource developed by the Edmonton Regional Learning Consortium (ERLC) that can be used in planning a new literacy program or enhancing one already in existence.\u00a0 The site is broken down into 6 main areas. Getting Started provides a framework for this instruction and offers guidance for determining whether instruction for individual learners should focus on emergent or conventional literacy.\u00a0 The Access to Communication section offers a number of resources to support access to and early development of skills in the areas of linguistic, social, operational, and strategic competence.\u00a0 Access to appropriate reading material and to effective writing supports\u00a0both contain important foundational information and practical resource suggestions. More in-depth information is also provided for emergent literacy...

When we read, we go beyond the text in the book to comment on the narrative and illustrations (e.g., \u201cOh no! He fell out of the tree.\u201d \u201cThis one is my favorite. I love his shiny scales\u201d), and ask questions (e.g., \u201cWhat happened to his pants?\u201d \u201cHow does he feel?\u201d). Interactive book reading helps to background knowledge, and connect things in the book to the learner\u2019s own life experiences, among other things. Asking questions is a big part of what we do in interactive book reading. Not only do they help us keep the learner engaged, but we also use them to model and provide practice on specific language targets. However, too many questions can cause learners to shut down, so we have to ensure that...

Developed by a team at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, this variation of the popular Tar Heel Reader website provides PCS\u00a0 symbol support for core words that can be used in discussing each book. You can learn more about Tar Heel Reader here. Their newest site focuses on interactive book reading and contains all of the same wonderful features as the original version plus several additional options. For example, you can specify which core words you are targeting while reading the book so that those appear in a strip below each page. That enables us to use those in modeling the symbols for those words as we talk and read the story. Sample phrases and sentences to...
