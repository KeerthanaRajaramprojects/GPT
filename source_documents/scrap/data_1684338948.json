When we read, we go beyond the text in the book to comment on the narrative and illustrations (e.g., \u201cOh no! He fell out of the tree.\u201d \u201cThis one is my favorite. I love his shiny scales\u201d), and ask questions (e.g., \u201cWhat happened to his pants?\u201d \u201cHow does he feel?\u201d). Interactive book reading helps to background knowledge, and connect things in the book to the learner\u2019s own life experiences, among other things. Asking questions is a big part of what we do in interactive book reading. Not only do they help us keep the learner engaged, but we also use them to model and provide practice on specific language targets. However, too many questions can cause learners to shut down, so we have to ensure that...

Along those same lines, here are some questions that we\u2019ve asked ourselves a few (dozen) times. Are these AAC devices/apps EVER going to be able to use context to know the tense and pronounce the word \u2018read\u2019 correctly? (Followed by an exasperated gesture) How is it that the student with disabilities can remember passwords that the nondisabled adults cannot? (Followed by a glance toward our \u2018Presume Competence\u2019 poster) Did he/she really just spell that out instead of using core words? (Followed by a low growl) Why is that device coming home from school fully charged? (Followed by a rise in blood pressure) Did I remember to turn off the laminator? (Followed by a face palm) How about you? What AAC-related questions do you ask yourself? Filed under: PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: AAC Therapist, questions, therapist February 16, 2013\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\t2 Comments . A few weeks ago we talked about AAC intervention to teach someone how to convey information that others want or need. Giving instructions, answering comprehension questions, and retelling a story all fit into the Light\u2019s category of \u2018information transfer.\u2019 Communicating in order to give information is only part of that story. Today, we complete the story by talking about getting information from others.\u00a0Not all questions are about getting information, of course. We also ask questions for other reasons, like getting something we want or need (e.g., \u201cMay I have a drink, please?\u201d) and socializing with friends/family (e.g., \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d \u201cWhat did you do for your birthday?\u201d). \u00a0But in this post, we focus on interrogatives that serve the purpose of getting needed information from a communication partner. Many times when we think of interrogatives in language therapy, the focus is on answering them accurately and appropriately. The skill...

Here\u2019s one quick and easy step in the right direction: Talk to them. We\u2019re not trying to be snarky here. The truth is that we speak less to people who are minimally verbal than we do to people who talk. In general, kids with AAC needs hear far less language than speaking children do. Fewer words heard means fewer opportunities to learn language. That\u2019s a cycle worth breaking. When we\u2019re around typically developing children, they\u2019re always asking questions. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the bag, Mom?\u201d \u201cWhy is she doing that?\u201d \u201cHow come Billy gets to have one and I don\u2019t?\u201d \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d \u201cAre we there yet?\u201d Kids ask lots of questions, particularly in the early years. Annoying? Sometimes. Valuable? Always. From a language learning perspective, those pesky questions serve a very useful purpose: they invite (or demand) a linguistic response. They...
