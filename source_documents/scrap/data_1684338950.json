Along those same lines, here are some questions that we\u2019ve asked ourselves a few (dozen) times. How about you? What AAC-related questions do you ask yourself? Filed under: PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: AAC Therapist, questions, therapist This post was written by Carole Zangari Asking Good Questions During Interactive Book Reading with AAC Learners You Might be an AAC Therapist If\u2026 Beyond Requesting: Thoughts on Teaching Interrogatives How to Use Magnets to Promote Language Development I love these \u2013 and have done most of them. My question is \u201cIs it rude to ask dinner guests to stay after dinner and help me cut up a PODD?\u201d Love that one, Jane! Ha, Jane! Mine is more like \u201cIs it rude to ask people over for dinner so they can cut PODD books? If so, do I really have to feed them since they\u2019ll have to put down the paper and scissors to eat?\u201d\nMy other main question is \u201cHow many times do I have to ask people not to use The Good Scissors to cut Velcro????\u201d Oh \u2013 Mary Louise! That\u2019s brilliant. Of course I don\u2019t have to feed them \u2013 what was I thinking! Is it ok to velcro shut a teacher\u2019s mouth after they tell you they had to take the student\u2019s SGD away because \u201che was talking too much\u201d!?!? Not a question but more of a restatement:  So what I hear you saying is that you would like ME to do all the programming\u2026 by tomorrow! Great post Carole! Thanks for sharing.
