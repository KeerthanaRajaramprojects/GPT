In this post, we have a number of resources for those who are ready to try their hand at implementation. Thanks to all who\u2019ve reached out with questions, comments, and words of appreciation for the Year of Core Vocabulary series. Here are some helpful resources for those who are using the words in Set 1 ( Year of Core Words) or Set 2 (Another Year of Core Words). If you are contemplating this approach, feel free to jump in at any time. The best time to start (or re-start) is right now. Don\u2019t worry about retracing steps, or not \u2018doing it right.\u2019 The best way to get better at core vocabulary instruction is just to keep at it. It takes time, practice, and a willingness to keep at it. Our words for this month are as follows. Set 1: all, down, good, little, my, question, sad, she, turn, up, who, why Set 2: bathroom, car, child, confused, green, hard, how much, man, mean, never, part, remember, sister, so, today, us A great many thanks to our colleagues Barbara Fernandes, Rachael Langley, Lisa Timm, Nancy Inman, Brian Whitmer, Russell Cross, Gail Van Tatenhove, Allison Wade, Heidi LoStracco, Bill and Lori Binko, Eric Sailers, and all the others who have contributed to this effort. Reading is a great way to build in some extra core word practice. If you like reading with your prAACtical pals, we have some book suggestions. The following list is for Set 1 words. May Calendars\u00a0 Rachael Langley\u2019s wonderful core word calendars have been showing up on bulletin boards and refrigerators around the globe. She has lots of fun and easy ideas for our May words.\u00a0(Click on the image to download the calendar for Set 1 words.)  \u00a0  \u00a0 Need some ideas for ways to target the May vocabulary beyond the single word level? Lisa Timm has some suggestions for us.  You can print out these sentences and the Set 2 calendar here.  Need even more ideas? Rachael Langley took care of that, too.
