It is gratifying to see the concept and these resources being used by teachers, clinicians, and parents. Today, we introduce an expansion of that concept with a specific focus on school-based AAC support. Say hello to the School Year of Core Words series. Conceptualized and created by AAC SLP Michaela Sullivan, and two pre-professional SLP students, Beth Lytle and Alisa Lego, the series begins with this introduction to the Level 1 and Level 2 words, and some information about what to expect as the series progresses. It will be followed by monthly posts with ideas, resources, and materials. The series follows a US academic calendar, running from August through June. You can learn more about the School Year of Core Word series creators, Michaela, Beth, and Alisa, at the end of this post. But first, let\u2019s get acquainted with the School Year of Core Words structure. Welcome to A SCHOOL YEAR OF CORE WORDS by Michaela Sullivan, Beth Lytle, & Alisa Lego To the parents, teachers, Speech-Language Pathologists, Para Professionals, friends, and other curious professionals or communicators: If you\u2019re looking for resources on core vocabulary, you are in the right place! Welcome to our first School Year of Core Words posting. You are amazing. You hold so much power. Connection is a two-way street. Thank you for joining us in helping to make this world easier to understand for our students with Complex Communication Needs. As a Speech-Language Pathologist and two second-year graduate students, we continue to be completely inspired by Augmentative Alternative Communication (AAC) and all of the ways we can reach each other with these life-changing strategies and supports.\u00a0 There are two separate word lists for the School Year of Core Word series. Levels 1 and 2 contain distinctly different sets of words.\u00a0 Level 1 is a foundational compilation of 158 words and Level 2 contains 161 words that build upon and beyond the foundation. The monthly word lists were selected to follow not only the school calendar but also support the needs of students, expanding communication functions in natural and more structured activities and settings (daily routines) as well as themes/holidays. We reviewed Browns\u2019 14 Morphemes and previous A Year of Core Vocabulary Words postings from PrAACtically Speaking published in 2013 and 2014 while considering our selections. We are so excited to share our passion project with you. Here are some of the things you\u2019ll find in each of the monthly School Year of Core Word posts.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s look at the words that will be featured in these posts. A School Year of Core Words-Level 1 A School-Year of Core Words-Level 1 is a compilation of 161 words and some pre-programmed phrases found on many Speech Generating Devices (SGD\u2019s)/AAC apps with semantic targets organized on a monthly basis within a school-year. Some months have fewer words due to vacation(s).\u00a0 Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, (and some words/phrases may not be available on the communication system), but such items were selected based on a variety of underlying principles of language development and the use of communication functions, previous year of core vocabulary choices and posts, (in PrAACtical AAC), topics in school, holidays and themes. You can download a document with the month-by-month word list for Level 1 words here. A School Year of Core Words-Level 2 (Intermediate) A School-Year of Core Words-Level 2 is also a compilation of core words and some pre-programmed phrases found on many SGD\u2019s and AAC apps with semantic targets organized on a monthly basis within a school-year. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, (and some words/phrases may not be available on the communication system) but such items were selected based a variety of underlying principles of language development, previous year of core vocabulary choices and posts (in PrAACtical AAC), themes and topics in school, holidays and overall student benefit.

Stephanie, thanks for taking the time to comment and share this positive feedback. This team is passionate about supports for core vocabulary and they\u2019ve spent a ton of time creating these materials. Stay tuned for their monthly posts with the first one set to publish tomorrow. Is there a subscription fee to get up coming month materials as they are published or a purchase fee? Thank you Roxanne, thanks for your question. All of the materials on PrAACtical AAC are free. You can download and use the files however you wish. Hope you enjoy using them! I work with students who use Caughdrop, LAMP, Wordpower, and Unity. This is an amazing resource! The Activity Sheets \u2013 soooo helpful! Thank you so much. You are in my bookmarks bar. This is great!  Are the September activities posted or do we need to join by subscription? Those are free and will be posted in the next few days. Thanks for your patience. It takes a lot of time for them to put these resources together. I am not able to find September, 2020 core word activities?  Also, if within a class, students do not have devices, does it matter which symbols are used for low tech core boards?  Depending on funding, they may receive a device with different symbols, would that be confusing? Those are coming in the next few days. You asked a really good question. It is not ideal to use one set of symbols for no tech core boards and then another set of symbols when they get a high tech SGD or full-featured AAC app. A lot of people go that route, but for the most efficient learning it would be helpful to keep the symbol set and layout consistent. Hello\nWill these be released month to month? Yes. They are finalizing the resources for this month and next right now. Eventually, we will post these at the end of one month so you can get set up for the upcoming month but it will take a little longer to get there. There\u2019s a LOT of work involved in creating these resources. Thank you for all of the amazing materials and ideas! I am so thankful I stumbled onto this.  Thank you for all your hard work and saving me some steps! Your email address will not be published.
