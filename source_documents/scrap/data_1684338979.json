Like any other activity, though, it won\u2019t be very helpful in doing that unless we use effective strategies. Today, we share an online module that will help with the basics of interactive book reading. Part of Project CONNECT, The Center to Mobilize Early Childhood Knowledge, which offers full courses for a fee and a limited set of modules (like the one we are sharing today) at no charge. This is a great starting place for anyone looking to better understand how to use shared reading as a way to build communication skills. From there, we can guide families, paraprofessionals, and professionals who work with AAC learners to utilize additional strategies, such as aided language input and descriptive talking, to support those who use some form of augmentative communication.

Planning those opportunities and teaching experiences is a big part of that process, both for those new to this approach and those who\u2019ve been doing it for awhile. In this week\u2019s featured video, Gail \u00a0Van Tatenhove offers ideas for how to structure this so that it is feasible and successful.

Provide Aided Language Input (ALI)\u2013 ALI is modeling AAC style. \u00a0Speak AAC to the AAC user. \u00a0 Use Scaffolding\u2013\u00a0Scaffolding is a verbal and visual strategy that has the facilitator build upon prior knowledge of the learner in order for the learner to integrate a new concept or skill. Model words and concepts to add information onto what the AAC user already knows and uses.\u00a0 Provide Expansions and Extensions\u2013 A form of modeling. \u00a0Add a word to the spontaneous communication from the learner. \u00a0The facilitator models a conceptual or grammatical word in the form of a model. Use Recasting\u2013\u00a0Recasts serve to add or correct information without obstructing the natural flow of communication. Recasting is another form of modelling. The...

Actually, we love active participation in all areas of life for us, for our students, for everyone. When Carole introduced the Building Participation Strategy of the Month, she discussed the role of the Participation Model\u00a0(Beukelman & Mirenda, 1988; 2013). The Participation Model is a framework for understanding the barriers to participation and then from a prAACtical intervention standpoint developing strategies and activities to increase active participation in a variety of (ALL) aspects of life. For the 2012 AAC Awareness Month, we discussed barriers to participation. This year\u2019s focus is on activities and strategies for getting past the barriers to building age appropriate authentic active participation for ALL learners. We have learned that when older learners with significant communication challenges are provided with age appropriate activities and supports, they can be engaged and motivated to participate and can often surprise us with...

Here are some of the things they\u2019re putting in their AAC toolkits. Making language visible:\u00a0Use visual supports to give information, explain, set boundaries, and make expectations clear. Aided language input and focused language stimulation: Teach AAC by speaking AAC. Communication temptations: Make the client want to communicate to get his/her own agenda met Expansions and extensions: The language facilitation strategies we all studied in our language intervention classes work in AAC, too! Repetition with variety: Working on the same thing in different ways is a sure way to build learning and keep treidthings fresh Contrastive examples: Teach through the power of clear examples, both positive AND negative\u00a0 Backward and forward chaining: Great for teaching things that have multiple steps, like sending emails or posting to Facebook Structure: Creating structure helps learner better...

They tell about ourselves and our connection to activities, places, and events. They tell about how we feel about people and experiences. Personal narratives help us structure and organize the events of our lives and even become a way of thinking about ourselves and our identities. We know many AAC users have significant difficulty with narratives. We always wonder though, is it a function of language difficulty or of access, exposure, and PrAACtice or more likely a combination.\u00a0 There are key intervention strategies that help AAC learners be able to tell personal narratives. You probably won\u2019t be surprised by what strategies work but the research from Gloria Soto and colleagues has shown us that when applied to personal narratives, AAC users can be competent story tellers. Some\u00a0Thoughts on Personal Narrative Assessment Even before assessment of the AAC learner, in all fairness,...

Partner-assisted scanning (PAS) offers great flexibility and spontaneity. Don\u2019t want to take your SGD to the beach? A print-out of the screens and PAS is a great option. Missing key messages for the trip to the doctor\u2019s office? A minute of brainstorming and the use of PAS may just save the day. No way for your client to access her device once she\u2019s in bed? A communication board/book and PAS just might do the trick. \u2013 2. Voice banking: For people are likely to lose their speech due to a degenerative disease, like ALS, the option of saving samples of their speech and having it digitized for future use seems to hold great appeal. We\u2019d love to see more SLPs familiarize themselves with this strategy and the tools to implement it, so that this option is more widely used about individuals whose speech is deteriorating. \u2013 3.
