In this post, Tina shares some thoughts on building meaningful conversations in the classroom. She also made her visual support materials available for downloading (link at the end of her post). You can read Tina\u2019s previous post for BHSM here. \u00a0 CONVERSATIONS IN THE CLASSROOM Fostering opportunities for meaningful conversation is critical throughout the school setting.\u00a0 Great discussions can happen in the classroom, but it can prove challenging for students to remain on topic, take conversational turns and give their peers wait time.\u00a0 In order to help students acquire these skills, we need to provide direct instruction, modeling by adults (and typically developing peers whenever possible!) and visual supports. Aim for the conversation target It can be difficult for students to keep track of the conversation target, especially in large group, fast-paced settings.\u00a0 It can be especially challenging for students who use AAC to communicate because it takes extra time to formulate a message.\u00a0 To remind students of the topic at hand, we can use a target as a visual support (see sample).\u00a0 As students take turns to make comments, ask questions and participate in the conversation, symbols can be placed on a target to provide feedback on whether they are remaining on the topic of conversation. Be sure to give everyone a chance to choose a topic!  Taking conversational turns Children need to learn that good conversations are balanced with everyone participating and with a mix of questions and comments.\u00a0 Conversation playing cards (see sample) can be utilized to help children visualize conversational turn taking and practice including everyone in the discussion. Once the topic is established (and assigned a visual reminder), ask students to pick a color.\u00a0 Students take turns \u201cplaying their conversation playing cards\u201d as they add their comments and questions until they\u2019ve played all of their cards.\u00a0 When everyone has participated in the conversation, encourage the group to examine the cards played.\u00a0 Did it seem fair?\u00a0 Did someone take too many consecutive turns?\u00a0 Did someone pose a question that went unanswered? \u00a0\u00a0Who forgot to ask a question?  Wait time Too much cannot be said about wait time.\u00a0 It is a very difficult skill to teach to children, but it\u2019s a tough thing for many adults to accept as well.\u00a0 Encourage your AAC communicators to develop a signal that lets everyone know when they need more time to formulate their messages.\u00a0 That can be as simple as a hand gesture or a prestored message such as \u201cGive me a sec!\u201d\u00a0 If children have difficulty waiting their turn to speak, try passing around a visual to remind the group whose turn it is to speak.\u00a0 This can be as simple as a ball or a stuffed animal.\u00a0 Giving the speaker a visual reminder for the other conversation partners to wait quietly, however, is very empowering (see sample)! Modeling by adults and peers is critical when teaching conversation skills.\u00a0 Video self-modeling can be utilized to help students watch their own successes over and over again.

She is also co-director of Camp ALEC, a week-long, residential literacy camp for children who communicate with AAC due to physical disabilities. Camp ALEC, with experts Drs. Karen Erickson and David Koppenhaver, will be offered August 9-15 at Indian Trails Camp in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
