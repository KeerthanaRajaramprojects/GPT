Today. Ohio-based SLP Tina Moreno helps us do just that as she returns to share more information on the reading and writing activities that AAC learners in Camp ALEC experienced.

In this post, Tina shares some thoughts on building meaningful conversations in the classroom. She also made her visual support materials available for downloading (link at the end of her post). You can read Tina\u2019s previous post for BHSM here. \u00a0 CONVERSATIONS IN THE CLASSROOM Fostering opportunities for meaningful conversation is critical throughout the school setting.\u00a0 Great discussions can happen in the classroom, but it can prove challenging for students to remain on topic, take conversational turns and give their peers wait time.\u00a0 In order to help students acquire these skills, we need to provide direct instruction, modeling by adults (and typically developing peers whenever possible!) and visual supports.

In this post, Tina shares some of the strategies that she has used to support AAC students in their classrooms.

In this post, we hear about one of them from\u00a0Tina Moreno, an SLP and mom of\u00a0Mateo, who uses PicturePower 100 on the Maestro to communicate, maintain friendships with his teammates on the cross country team, advocate for himself, reveal his wicked sense of humor, and even sing the National Anthem for his high school\u2019s basketball games. Tina blogs at Voices4All. \u00a0With the help of \u00a0Drs. Karen Erickson and David Koppenhaver, she and her friend Gina Cunningham created Camp ALEC together in memory of Gina\u2019s son Alec, who never gave up, and...
