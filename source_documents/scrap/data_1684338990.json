Vicki joins us periodically to share some of the work completed by her SLP graduate students. Under her leadership, they create videos, handouts, and other materials that can be used by families, clinicians, and educators. Let\u2019s take a look.\u00a0\u00a0 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: As I have said in previous posts about teaching the graduate class on AAC, I find Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to be a very helpful framework when designing the course, although I\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t typically name UDL when I discuss activities or assignments. But I was thrilled when Lindsey Hull came to me wanting to look at integrating students who use AAC within the general education classroom, and we got to talk about UDL. She put together a narrated PowerPoint full of great ideas for...

No matter what the format for instruction, one of the most important things for students who use AAC is having their SLPs, teachers, and families on the same page. They each have a different but very intense relationship with the student\u2019s AAC system. Today, we reprise a popular post with some prAACtical thoughts on getting everyone pointed in the same direction. 1. \u00a0Develop a communication profile of the student: In the initial weeks, try to get a baseline of how the student is communicating at the start of the year. For beginning communicators, we track things like their communicative intents (WHY they are communicating), modalities (HOW they are communicating), and the frequency of their communication. We\u2019ve written about one of our favorite...

In today\u2019s post, we hear from Elena Feder, who introduces us to the \u2018Communication World\u2019 approach. Elena is an AAC SLP at the New England Assistive Technology (NEAT) Center in Connecticut and has a lot to share about AAC implementation. Don\u2019t miss the wonderful planning tool that she shares at the end. Before we get to that, though, take a look at the AAC Summer Bash that she runs with her colleague and fellow SLP Sarah Brink. In normal times, this is a face-to-face experience but due to the novel coronavirus, it has migrated to an online event. There are a few other things that you might like to know about the AAC Summer Bash. It\u2019s free! You\u2019re invited! You must register by July 17th. The AAC Summer Bash...

Based on feedback from that post, we\u2019re sharing a sample data collection form for this purpose. Do you have another idea for collecting data on the behavior of communication partners? We\u2019d love to hear about it.

We are all motivated by different things, though, and sometimes it can be hard to figure out the specifics of what a particular learner likes well enough for it to be used as reinforcement. Sometimes it\u2019s easy. We all know kids who would do anything for [iPad time; Thomas the Tank Engine, Super Why, Pokemon, Hello Kitty] or [you fill in the blank]. We can use those in formal and informal ways to keep these learners motivated and engaged. And that\u2019s important because, often, what we are asking them to do is hard. But sometimes, we work with people for whom those \u2018magic motivators\u2019 aren\u2019t so clear. The \u2018typical\u2019 reinforcers don\u2019t seem to work for those folks, and that can slow down progress. How can we figure out what motivates...

The month wouldn\u2019t seem complete without hearing more of Vicki Clarke\u2019s ideas on AAC assessment. In addition to many other things, Vicki\u2019s practice, Dynamic Therapy Associates, does 50+ of these evaluations each year, both in the clinic and in school settings. In this post, Vicki shares some thoughts on assessing the AAC skills of people who use direct\u00a0selection. As always, she packs in a lot of information and generously provides the protocol and data collection forms that she uses. You can explore some of her previous posts in the AAC Assessment Corner series here.\u00a0* ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: AAC Skills Assessment for Direct Selectors I spent the morning with a great group of students at the University of Georgia (UGA) in Dr. Satterfield\u2019s AAC class.\u00a0 I was asked to talk with them about AAC assessment with an emphasis on...

In this post, Tina shares some of the strategies that she has used to support AAC students in their classrooms. If you are a school-based SLP, don\u2019t miss Tina\u2019s\u00a0classroom observation form for gathering data on how AAC is being used in various activities and lessons. GIVE THEM FIVE As an SLP in the school setting, helping teachers support students in the classroom can be a big challenge.\u00a0 While we can see students making progress in our therapy sessions, it can be difficult to get the same results in the classroom.\u00a0 An important role of the SLP is to collaborate with teachers to help students generalize these skills in conversation with their peers and other...

Here are some of our prAACtical thoughts about data collection. 1. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew. We\u2019ve visited several programs where the client data filled a huge 3-ring binder. In some places, they logged the data daily, reviewed it frequently, and actually USED it to make programmatic decisions. If that works for you, great! But most programs only reviewed the data when they had to report it or prior to a visit by someone who might want to see and discuss those data. In those cases, the data really wasn\u2019t serving it\u2019s original purpose: to see how instruction might need to be tweaked for a client who was learning quickly, slowly, or not at all. The takeaway: Don\u2019t collect more data than you\u2019re prepared to review and put to use. 2. We should...
