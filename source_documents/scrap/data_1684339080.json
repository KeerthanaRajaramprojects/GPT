Her practice,\u00a0Dynamic Therapy Associates, serves children and adults with significant communication challenges in clinical and educational settings. Most of Vicki\u2019s guest posts have been on the topic of assessment (click here to view them), but in this post, she shares her thoughts on the role of core vocabulary in AAC systems. \u00a0 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I\u2019ve enjoyed listening to the wonderful presenters at the AAC In The Cloud sessions last week.\u00a0 It\u2019s exciting to see AAC knowledge being shared to such a wide and varied audience!\u00a0 Core vocabulary was a hot topic last week so I thought it would be a good time to chat about it! At conferences, in blogs, all over the internet and from your AAC specialists, you may have gotten the memo that Core Vocabulary is an important component of AAC.\u00a0 As a group of professionals, we have done a great job finally communicating that message clearly! Hurray! Now that we all understand we need core words to learn to generate language, it\u2019s time to go to the next level in understanding vocabulary/message selection for our children!\u00a0 Core vocabulary is one, very important, research-based method of presenting words and messages on an AAC system.\u00a0 There are tons of resources out there now for teaching core, so I won\u2019t belabor the point- go take a look at these favorites of mine: Core is important. We need it.\u00a0  Okay, but what else do we need?\u00a0 The biggest weakness of AAC is the amount of time it takes to say something.\u00a0 The second biggest weakness is that it is difficult to say specifically what you want to say. Core vocabulary helps us with some of these challenges in that it gives us the basic words we need to basically get our basic message across.\u00a0 \u201cI want that.\u201d \u201cNot this.\u201d \u201cLike it.\u201d \u201cNot like it.\u201d \u201cI go.\u201d \u201cYou do it.\u201d SPECIFIC NOUN VOCABULARY IN CATEGORIES As you\u2019ve probably heard, core vocabulary consists of approximately 80% of the words we use.\u00a0 But what about the other 20%?\u00a0 What if you didn\u2019t have the word \u201ccoffee\u201d on your device?\u00a0 I don\u2019t know about you, but I wouldn\u2019t be writing this article because I wouldn\u2019t be functioning (or at a minimum, I would be grumpy). So we know, in Vicki\u2019s world, \u201ccoffee\u201d needs to be on the device.\u00a0 Also Chuck, Ashley, Alex, Penni, Mom and Dad, because those are My People (and dog).\u00a0 And I couldn\u2019t live without Dunkin Donuts, Dynamic Therapy, Crossfit, Destin, Publix, Walmart (I know..) and Walgreens.\u00a0 Let\u2019s also add doughnuts, bacon, farm fresh eggs, steak and Cape Cod 40% Reduced Fat Original Kettle Cooked Potato Chips. For some of our emergent communicators these specifics are even more important than they are to me.\u00a0 We know our children need to be\u00a0 motivated to communicate in order to be successful. Let\u2019s face it, specific words are simply more interesting to communicate. When we are getting that initial \u201cbuy in\u201d to the value of communication, you can\u2019t often beat a good specific word, say \u201cGoldfish!\u201d Specific terms also are more concrete, so that\u2019s helpful (not IMPERATIVE FOR ALL, but often helpful for some). None of this is to say that a child only needs specific nouns.\u00a0 Absolutely not!\u00a0 But they DO need to be available, and for some of our children, specific nouns is where we start.\u00a0 That being said, Even if specific nouns make the most sense to the child, you still want to expose, model and teach core words! CONTEXT BASED MESSAGING Now, on to another research based method of organizing our messages.\u00a0 Context based messaging is simply looking at a child\u2019s typical environment and providing the routine messages and words that are required in order for him to communicate effectively (and efficiently).\u00a0 When we carefully document the environment we call this an \u201cecological inventory,\u201d for those of you wanting to be fancy.\u00a0 Having context based messages is NOT the same as having pages and pages of activity based words.\u00a0 Contexts/environments/topics which occur frequently in a child\u2019s life are critical places and times he needs to be able to communicate daily.\u00a0 We aren\u2019t talking about Potato Head and Play-Doh.\u00a0 We are talking about Bathroom, Meal Time, Living Room and Riding in the Car.\u00a0 Each of these environments is encountered every day, and has the opportunity for communicating exactly the same messages each time.\u00a0 \u201cHow much longer?\u201d \u201cI need to go to the bathroom!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s ON MY SIDE!\u201d are messages you might hear every time you are in the car with your child.\u00a0 Does it make sense for your child to select each individual word (and navigate to the specifics) to say these messages?\u00a0 Remember that time issue AAC users have?\u00a0 Having some well thought out, repeatable messages associated with routine contexts/environments/topics is a way to allow our child to be EFFICIENT. Is there more?\u00a0 Of course! TEXT TO SPEECH- SPELLING- KEYBOARDS Like all those noun categories, having the ability to be specific is important.\u00a0 Keyboards and spelling cannot be beat for allowing a person to be specific.\u00a0 Literacy development is paramount for our AAC users, and you can\u2019t learn to spell if you don\u2019t have access to letters- so let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a keyboard on board. As with all such subjects, the black and white discussion of CORE versus PHRASES is a silly simplification of how we select and organize vocabulary for our kids.\u00a0 A little of both, and some other extras are really what we need. \u00a0\u00a0 One size does not fit all and everyone likes a little variety in their closet!\u00a0  OR We all need plain old underwear (core) but rainbow tie-died Lularoe leggings (specific nouns) that keep you warm when it\u2019s winter (context based) are pretty darn important too!\u00a0  Filed under: Featured Posts, PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: core vocabulary, vocabulary selection This post was written by Carole Zangari School Year of Core Vocabulary Words: AAC Resources for Month 10 (May) by Michaela Sullivan, Alisa Lego, & Beth Lytle PrAACtically April \u2013 More AAC Resources for A Year of Core Words School Year of Core Vocabulary Words: AAC Resources for Month 9 (April) by Michaela Sullivan, Alisa Lego, & Beth Lytle TELL ME About It: AAC Learning with \u2018The Skin You Live In\u2019! The timing of your post is uncanny. Last week I decided I was going to add more phrases to our core system, for exactly the reasons you stated. I was discussing this our SLP on Friday and I was so relieved she agreed. I think the important thing in AAC is to be flexible and tailor the system for the user and their support team. I am hopeful that my daughter will benefit from having both core and some well placed phrases in her system. Yes! Rarely is there one answer to how messages should be organized! We are all multi-modal communicators and that goes for the words we use too! Thank you for this post! Would you be able to cite some articles supporting use of core words with AAC users? thank you!
