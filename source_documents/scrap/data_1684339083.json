Here are some ways we can support that process. Provide messages for self-advocacy behaviors: It\u2019s hard to represent your own interests without the appropriate set of vocabulary and messages. Words and prestored messages for protesting and rejecting are essential (e.g., No; Stop; No, thank you; I don\u2019t want to). In addition, consider adding messages which allow the communicator to express disagreement or negative opinions (e.g., I don\u2019t like it; I don\u2019t think so; That doesn\u2019t work for me; This is unfair; That\u2019s disrespectful) and proactively provide self-advocacy information (e.g., Please do what I asked; It\u2019s on my IEP; I have a right to be heard; I...

Her practice,\u00a0Dynamic Therapy Associates, serves children and adults with significant communication challenges in clinical and educational settings. Most of Vicki\u2019s guest posts have been on the topic of assessment (click here to view them), but in this post, she shares her thoughts on the role of core vocabulary in AAC systems. \u00a0 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I\u2019ve enjoyed listening to the wonderful presenters at the AAC In The Cloud sessions last week.\u00a0 It\u2019s exciting to see AAC knowledge being shared to such a wide and varied audience!\u00a0 Core vocabulary was a hot topic last week so I thought it would be a good time to chat about it! At conferences, in blogs, all over the internet and from your AAC specialists, you may have gotten the memo that Core Vocabulary is an important component...

For whom is that appropriate? How many words? Which ones? In today\u2019s featured video, master clinician Gail Van Tatenhove tackles all of these issues and more. This video and the accompanying resources (which can be found here) were part of the Power AAC series Gail created for \u00a0PaATTAN\u00a0to support their efforts in building capacity for high quality AAC services. We\u2019re indebted to them for making this available so all can learn from it.

Frustration Parents and teachers frequently ask SLPs to help learners further develop the skill of being able to say what is troubling them. Those are skills worth developing, of course. But a first step may be to review the vocabulary and messages available to the learner and consider making some adjustments. It is fine to be able to say what is wrong, but it\u2019s even better to be able to explain what happened and what kind of help you might need. \u00a0Here are some ideas for messages to consider. Sadness Because\u2026[I remembered a sad thing that happened; Something happened to me; I\u2019m lonely; I miss someone; I was left out; Someone got hurt. Something else.] It would help if\u2026[add student\u2019s preferred solution strategies Anger Because\u2026[Something bad happened; I want to do something else; Someone hurt me; It\u2019s unfair; I\u2019m not sure why; Something else.] I need\u2026[Some time...

In this video, we learn about the issues surrounding this important task and discover some strategies for approaching it. Thanks to Dr. Rae Sonnenmeir for her work in this series.

Core words are central, for most people who use AAC, but we always want to include the words that help them express very specific and personal experiences. There are several checklists and questionnaires floating around that can help identify the fringe vocabulary. Here are two of our favorites. Young children: AAC Team at Penn State University. School-aged Students: Lauren Enders and Laurie McGowan\u00a0 Do you have a vocabulary selection checklist or form that you like to use? We\u2019d love to hear about it. \u00a0 Filed under: PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: form, resource, vocabulary checklist, vocabulary selection September 19, 2013\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\t2 Comments Would you want someone else to pick the car you drive? How happy would you be if someone else selected your wardrobe? How would it feel if the only things you could say were based on words that someone else decided were appropriate for you? Choosing vocabulary is a BIG responsibility. When the client is not fully literate, he/she is constrained to communicating with the words we provide and nothing more. If we left out important concepts, he\u2019s stuck. If we worded the message in a style/tone that doesn\u2019t fit her personality, she\u2019ll be reluctant to use the AAC to communicate. Given this, it makes sense to involve the client in the process of choosing the single words, phrases, sentences, and narratives that we put on the AAC device or in the communication book. If the client is involved, then the messages we end up with are more likely to...

You can\u2019t go wrong with Lauren Enders\u2019 Pinterest board on this topic. She\u2019s collected some wonderful posts, documents, and videos. Check it out here. Filed under: PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: Lauren Enders, Pinterest, resources, vocabulary selection April 16, 2013\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\tLeave your thoughts Although we are deeply invested in AAC systems that have a robust set of core language, that doesn\u2019t mean we insist that our clients generate sentences word-by-word all the time. There are lots of good reasons for pre-storing longer messages. Here are some of them. Emergency messages: When we\u2019re communicating about things like spasms, seizures, pain, medication, fear, and danger, time is of the essence. The quicker, the better. Examples: \u201cMy asthma is kicking up. Get my puffer, please.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m having a back spasm. Take me out of my chair.\u201d \u201cI think my sugar is off. Can you do a finger prick to check my levels?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m scared. Can you help me?\u201d Partner instructions and communication transaction messages: Sometimes we communicate about communicating. In AAC, it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to set the stage for how the interaction will proceed or provide their partner with specific directions. When communicating to...

Last month, we followed her along to the zoo where her little friends got to generalize the language skills developed in therapy sessions. In this post, Shareka discusses her approach to something we all struggle with: selecting vocabulary that will both fun and functional. \u00a0 One of my biggest challenges in AAC is choosing good vocabulary targets, and working on vocabulary instruction for early communicators.\u00a0 By \u2018good\u2019 I mean targets which are functional for their everyday settings, representative, and most of all fun for children who are not only beginning communicators, but also beginning AAC users. \u00a0I have become the AAC \u2018specialist\u2019 at a school for children with complex communication needs, so I generally have to cater to the communicative needs of children from the pre-communication to...
