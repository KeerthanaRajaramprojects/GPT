We\u2019ve got a cognitive-communication screener you might want to add to your toolbox\u2014plus a way to convert between MMSE and MOCA scores. June 4, 2022 Download If you\u2019re in the cognitive screening business, you\u2019ve heard of the MOCA. And if you\u2019ve heard of the MOCA, you know it used to be free to administer, but now requires a $125.00 certification fee. This has caused quite a bit of confusion for SLPs, as it seems our training should exempt us from this requirement (which was put in place to ensure quality administration).\u00a0 \u00a0 Some SLPs still use the MOCA without certification while others work in facilities that require them to become certified, sometimes even having to pay out of pocket. Whatever your interpretation of the guidelines or the policies where you work, it\u2019s always nice to have another option, especially one that\u2019s supported by evidence.\u00a0 \u00a0 Iosa and colleagues found that the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) is a clinically valuable tool for determining cognitive-communication needs in people post-stroke. It\u2019s similar to other cog-comm screeners you may give, but allows you to show areas of impairment and of strength in this caregiver-friendly figure. The OCS is more sensitive than the MOCA, more aphasia-friendly, and is available in many languages. \u00a0 You can access scoring instructions and administration training videos (including one on remote administration) here for free. You can download a sample version of the test book and patient pack here, but you need to request a license for an unmarked version. These licenses are free if you are using the OCS for publicly funded research or clinical work and if you request the UK English version.\u00a0 \u00a0 But we know that some settings or physicians just prefer specific cog-screeners. If you find yourself in that situation, check out this open access solution from Roheger and colleagues. Table 2 converts MMSE scores to MOCA scores for people with dementia\u2014including separate categories of people with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, vascular dementia, Parkinson\u2019s dementia/Lewy body dementia (a smaller sample), and dementia and stroke. Table 3 does the same thing in reverse, converting MOCA scores to MMSE scores.\u00a0 Say you\u2019ve got a referring provider who is most familiar with the MOCA, but you\u2019ve already administered the MMSE. Using these conversions can prevent you from having to put your patient with dementia through another screener by allowing you to discuss what the patient\u2019s score is likely to have been on the MOCA.\u00a0 \u00a0 No shade to you, MOCA. We still love you, but there are some new resources in town!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Editor's Note: The original text of this review said that the OCS was simply free. It is, in fact, free for all publicly funded clinical use, but only when you request the UK English version. Translated versions (including US English) incur a cost when you request a license.\u00a0 \u00a0 Iosa, M., Demeyere, N., Abruzzese, L., Zoccolotti, P., & Mancuso, M. (2022).
