Request a quote Erin McQuivey, MS, CCC-SLP Outpatient Pediatric SLP TISLP is the first place I go when I encounter something in my clinical practice that I want to know more about. The search features make it fast and easy to navigate. The variety of formats give me what I want, how I want it. I find it very intuitive. It\u2019s like it knows how an SLP thinks! Becky, MS, CCC-SLP Inpatient Rehab Hospital The Informed SLP makes it so easy and enjoyable to stay up to date with the latest research. I love how the article summaries are broken down into accessible terms and include takeaways that I can immediately use in my practice. So very grateful for this resource! Briana R, MS, CCC-SLP Private Practice SLP TISLP has been an amazing way for me to continue to be informed on current research and best practices, while maintaining my busy SLP schedule. As the lead of the speech department at a private practice, I can feel confident that I am helping my own clients and the clients of the SLPs that I supervise have the best clinical outcomes. Amanda Mahler, MA, CCC-SLP Midland County ESA As a busy, traveling special ed SLP, time for CE and learning about new best practices in our field is hard to come by. TISLP is a lifesaver. I listen to the reviews while driving, and answer a quick question for CE credit when I arrive at my next therapy location. I am implementing new EBP with every student\u2013 without weekend journal reading! Hannah, MA, CCC-SLP Hinds County Schools It is a reminder to do a monthly check-in about why I am doing what I am doing.  As I listen to reviews, I think through my caseload and what I need to modify, scrap, or re-energize.  Sometimes the reviews are exactly what I needed and sometimes it inspires me to dig deeper about a new question. Hailey Pedersen, MS, CCC-SLP Early Childhood SLP It makes the research easily and quickly digestible. I feel like I\u2019m more able to practice at the top of the license now that I\u2019m staying current on the research. EBP was always something that was intimidating and I never knew how to do it, especially as a school SLP. Now I have access to it and it feels great! Melissa, MS, CCC-SLP Outpatient Pediatric SLP I feel so much more confident explaining to parents and colleagues why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. I have research to back up my treatment and have clear examples and ways to phrase explanations. I love saving posts where I learned something new (or what I could be doing better!) and referencing them over and over again. Samantha DiNello, MA, CCC-SLP Early Intervention SLP I bought a subscription right out of grad school because I wanted to stay up to date on EBP. I love knowing that I can search anything SLP related and find easy to digest, relevant, AND evidence-based help! I use this subscription on a regular basis to check myself. It\u2019s a confidence booster when the research agrees with your practice! TISLP is the first place I go when I encounter something in my clinical practice that I want to know more about.
