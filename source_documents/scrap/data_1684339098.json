We'll go through 7 analysis tools for videofluroscopic swallow studies (yes, there's a printable chart) so you can find the best fit for your facility.\u00a0 October 4, 2022 Download We know it\u2019s best practice to use a specific study protocol and a standardized approach for analyzing and reporting VFSS results (see here and here). It provides guidelines to ensure we\u2019re doing the same thing each time we conduct a swallow study (also called a modified barium swallow study) and holds us to a higher standard in our analysis and report writing. This benefits everyone: the patient, \u00a0the physician reading our reports, and us getting our patients to the next level of care. \u00a0 \u00a0 You\u2019ve probably heard of a few (MBSImP, anyone?), but it can be hard to choose when there are so many options, plus funding and productivity concerns to balance. You just want to select the best tool for your facility, after all, and no one likes having to choose twice. \u00a0 We took the time to compare a number of the VFSS analysis tools that are out there. We skipped tools that only measure one thing (like the Penetration Aspiration Scale) and focused on the more comprehensive tools meant to help you capture the study as a whole. The ones featured here are the ones we\u2019ve seen frequently mentioned in research or often used by clinicians; there are more tools out there. You\u2019ll want to keep in mind, though, that even clinicians with certifications in interpreting instrumental swallow studies or their BCS-S tend to struggle with identifying primary physiologic impairments in patients with complex swallowing difficulties unless they\u2019re using frame-by-frame analysis. We\u2019ve pointed out which tools make use of this strategy. Below, we\u2019ve broken down everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about these VFSS tools. It\u2019s a lot, but you can also download this easily digestible chart that includes more information about research, time, and bolus selection\u2014another tool at your disposal, if you will.\u00a0 \u00a0 (Download the PDF here)\u00a0 \u00a0 ASPEKT-C: Analysis of Swallowing Physiology: Events, Kinematics and Timing (Clinical) \u00a0 DIGEST:\u00a0 Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity \u00a0 DOSS: Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale\u00a0 MBSImP: Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile mVDS: Modified Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia Scale Swallowtail VIP: Videofluroscopic Interpretation of Physiology\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to download our printable chart here to compare these tools, including more information and research you might need to justify your choice of VFSS analysis tool for your facility. \u00a0 Whether you\u2019re looking to advance your own med SLP skills, working on a process improvement project, or wanting to get on the same page as the other SLPs in your facility, implementing any single analysis tool like these will help you level up. Even using modified versions to suit your needs (ahem, hello productivity requirements) can be a good starting point for improvement.\u00a0\u00a0 Psst!
