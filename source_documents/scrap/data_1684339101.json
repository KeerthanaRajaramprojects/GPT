How should we be thinking about the role screens play in kids' lives? There are more questions than answers, but we'll talk it through together.\u00a0 April 11, 2023 Download \u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about these YouTube videos that can teach my toddler to talk?\u201d \u201cKids these days. They spend all their time on tablets instead of playing outside.\u201d \u201cI read about this study that says too much screen time at a young age causes a language delay.\u201d \u201cI try to set limits around screen time but my kid has such a meltdown when I take it away, and I just don\u2019t have the energy (or time) to deal with it.\u201d \u201cAll this worry and drama about screen time is blown way out of proportion. The research is all flawed, anyway.\u201d \u201cI know he\u2019s already had an hour of tablet time today, but I just really need to shower.\u201d \u00a0 Debates about screen time and its effects on kids are far-reaching, and everyone comes to them with their own experiences, perspectives, levels of worry or shame, and biases. Because of this, it\u2019s (perhaps ironically) really difficult to discuss screen time and its related issues online via social media with people we don\u2019t know personally.\u00a0 \u00a0 Thankfully, when working with families directly, we have the unique opportunity to listen to where caregivers are coming from, hear what anxiety or experiences they are bringing with them, and then speak to what they specifically may need to hear. In light of that, let\u2019s go over the current recommendations, what we know (and don\u2019t know!) about screen time and language development, a framework for evaluating children\u2019s media, and some ways we can approach this loaded topic with families. \u00a0 The American Academy of Pediatrics published its most recent policy statement about early childhood and digital media in 2016, and by now we\u2019re all familiar with the guidelines:\u00a0 While these recommendations are valuable at a policy level, they aren\u2019t definitive rules to live by. For example, Dynia et al. found that the \u201cone hour a day\u201d guideline was not significantly associated with children\u2019s language abilities in low-resourced homes. Additionally, enforcing this somewhat arbitrary rule contributed to parents\u2019 stress and reduced their self-efficacy, possibly doing more harm than good. When working with families, we need a more personalized approach\u2014which we\u2019ll get to!\u2014but first, let\u2019s look at what the research has to say.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The relationship between early language development and screen time is certainly complex. We\u2019ve covered studies that have found a relationship, and ones that haven\u2019t. This is one of those cases where, for any question, \u201cit depends\u201d is the most common answer. It depends on the child\u2019s age and developmental profile; it depends on context and co-viewing; it depends on the type of screen time\u2014and on and on. Let\u2019s look at some examples. \u00a0 \u00a0 Karani et al. reviewed studies on how screen time and language development are related and found both positive and negative effects, depending on a number of factors, including parental involvement, co-viewing, the child\u2019s age, and characteristics of the media being watched. \u00a0 \u00a0 Linebarger & Vaala argue that it depends on various factors like characteristics of the child and their environment, plus\u2014again\u2014the actual content being viewed. Digital media is more likely to support learning if it:\u00a0 Additionally, Strouse et al. showed that an adult modeling participation with a video (e.g., doing motions, singing along) could support kids\u2019 ability to learn new words from the video.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While describing the nuances of studies\u2019 findings is important, we also need to consider the more foundational issues with screen time research. Here\u2019s the overarching reality: our current body of research is riddled with issues. Let\u2019s explore three issues that limit how useful screen time research really is: \u00a0 1. The issue of measurement \u00a0 Research is only useful in so far as it accurately measures what we are trying to understand. And yet, per a recent review by Browne et al., we don\u2019t yet have tools to measure digital technology use in accurate and meaningful ways. We actually don\u2019t even have clear definitions of what all \u201cscreen time\u201d entails. How are we supposed to draw meaningful conclusions if we can\u2019t accurately measure what we\u2019re studying?\u00a0 \u00a0 It\u2019s clear that \u201cscreen time\u201d is not one thing. It can include video-chatting with relatives, playing games on a phone, watching a movie with the family, doing homework, reading e-books, scrolling TikTok, and the list goes on. Collapsing all of the ways that we and our children interact with technology in our daily lives into \u201cscreen time\u201d reduces something that is highly complex, dynamic, and evolving, into a category that holds little practical meaning. Browne et al. recommend that it may be time to move beyond the term \u201cscreen time\u201d in favor of more descriptive and specific terms. \u00a0 2. The issue of drawing clinical implications from population research \u00a0 Beyond measurement, there\u2019s also how we analyze and make sense of what we see in the data. It\u2019s tempting to look at a huge population data set and draw the conclusion that because the sample size is so big the results must be really powerful and have important clinical implications. But what can get clouded here is that results can be statistically significant on a large scale while having little practical meaning on the individual level.\u00a0 \u00a0 To illustrate, Orben & Przybylski compared the relationship between adolescent well-being and technology use to other factors. They found that the association between technology and poorer well-being was essentially on par with the negative \u201ceffects\u201d of\u2014get this\u2014wearing glasses or eating potatoes regularly. So maybe there are worse things than being a TV \u201cspec\u201d-\u201ctater\u201d? Sorry, we couldn\u2019t resist. Conversely, the positive associations of getting enough sleep and eating breakfast daily far outweighed the negative associations of digital technology use. All that to say, the actual clinical implications from large population studies are limited and often falsely inflated. \u00a0 3. The issue of correlation vs causation \u00a0 A third issue with the interpretation of research studies lies in the reliance on correlational data to make causal inferences. Ah yes, correlation vs causation, our old nemesis. We often rely on correlational data when we can\u2019t feasibly (or ethically) conduct a randomized controlled trial. This is definitely the case with screen time since we can\u2019t randomly assign one group of children to \u201creceive\u201d screen time, and another to not get any.\u00a0 \u00a0 To get around this, researchers will try to account for as many confounding variables as possible in their analysis. So for screen time, they\u2019ll control for income, maternal education, age, gender, etc., and then say, \u201cOK, now we\u2019re sure that we\u2019re comparing apples with apples.\u201d But humans, I think we can agree, are not reducible to demographic data points, which makes interpreting that type of data somewhat fraught.\u00a0 \u00a0 For an excellent discussion on the nuances and limits of correlational research, check out parenting economist Emily Oster\u2019s recent post on the topic. \u00a0 \u00a0 Definitely not, but to grapple with it we may need to widen our lens. While it\u2019s clear that research on screen time is flawed and dominates the conversation in misleading ways, another thing is also clear: caregivers and children face myriad challenges, especially in the wake of the pandemic, and \u201cscreen time\u201d is part of that bigger picture. It\u2019s impossible to tease apart screens from other concerns such as lack of affordable childcare or paid parental leave, financial insecurity, distracted and stressed caregivers, and widespread spikes in mental health challenges. The question then becomes, what do we do about all these things? \u00a0 That is a question that\u2019s not easily answered with a bulleted list. But remember how we started off by saying that we\u2019d end up with more questions than answers? We would argue this is a good thing. It\u2019s critical that we engage our curiosity and direct our attention and questions to the broader issues our communities face. Instead of focusing all our attention on individuals\u2019 behaviors, we need to zoom out in order to see the systemic issues at play.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Let\u2019s ask questions about the companies that profit off of our children\u2019s attention, and why apps and media for children are designed to be addictive. Let\u2019s ask why the ability to disengage from technology is ever-increasingly becoming a matter of resources. Let\u2019s ask why we heap so much shame and pressure on parents (and on ourselves) to make all of the \u201cright\u201d parenting choices rather than putting our focus and energy into creating a society that prioritizes the well-being of children and caregivers at a systemic level. And finally, let\u2019s ask questions together about what we truly hope for ourselves, our communities, and our children. And then from there, let\u2019s consider how technology can support or hinder that vision. What we pay attention to and the questions we ask matter. Let\u2019s invest our attention and energy wisely.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 *deep breath* \u00a0So, how do we talk about all of this with families? \u00a0 \u00a0 Perhaps the most common way that the topic of screen time shows up in our work as SLPs is related to educational or \u201ctherapeutic\u201d media and apps. There are some points worth emphasizing here.\u00a0 \u00a0 In today\u2019s rapidly evolving digital landscape, we need to move beyond absolutes and hard-and-fast rules like \u201cscreen time is bad\u201d or \u201conly one hour per day.\u201d These rules aren\u2019t practical for most families, and can further a shame-based \u201cabstinence\u201d mindset. Rather, we need a compassionate, realistic framework that considers a scale of relative risks and benefits. This includes taking the context, the content, the child, and the caregivers into consideration. \u00a0 (Note that here we are talking about digital media such as games, videos, and children\u2019s apps. Video-chatting and AAC apps are important exceptions.) \u00a0 The context matters. Look at everything surrounding how the child engages with digital media. The content matters. Not all children\u2019s content is created equal. Here are some things to keep in mind. The child matters. Children vary in how they respond to and engage with digital media. Encourage caregivers to consider their specific child. The caregivers matter. Parents\u2019 purposes and attitudes about screen time vary widely. Chong et al. found that caregivers\u2019 reasons for allowing screen time ranged from using it as a distraction (or \u201cbabysitter\u201d) to using it for educational purposes or as a reward. Some caregivers viewed screen time as a necessity and encouraged it, while others were concerned about the negative impact of screen time on their child\u2019s development. \u00a0 Because there is such a range of perspectives, a parent\u2019s values and priorities are important to consider rather than \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d messaging. Reducing screen time may not be a priority for all families. In fact, screens may be an important coping tool for a family for any number of reasons and provide them with real benefits. If caregivers ask questions or would like assistance in thinking through their child\u2019s media habits, here are some things to keep in mind: Are you new to The Informed SLP?
