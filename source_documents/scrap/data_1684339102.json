With over two decades of experience in pediatric rehabilitation practice in private and public settings, Alicia\u2019s ideas for how to support AAC learners and their families are tried and true.

Alicia is the clinical lead of the AAC Clinic at One Kids Place, a children\u2019s treatment centre in northern Ontario. She has over 20 years of experience in pediatric rehabilitation practice in private and public settings, including clinical practice in AAC clinics and programs in Wisconsin, Florida, and now in Ontario.\u00a0In this post, Alicia addresses one of our favorite clinical strategies in a very prAACtical way.
