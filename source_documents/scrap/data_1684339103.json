More time spent looking at screens goes with a higher risk of language and learning difficulties in young children, but the relationship isn't straightforward\u2014here's what else we have to consider. November 13, 2019 Download Most young children are exposed to screens. At home, daycare, preschool, and school. Large studies have found that kids under the age of five get an average of 1.5 to 3 hours per day (and that\u2019s just average). All while the AAP recommends no more than one hour per day for this age group. \u00a0 Screen time and early childhood development has been a really hot topic in 2019 in general, but this last month in particular. Popular news outlets have been covering research on it (e.g. here and here). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Upon closer examination, the research isn\u2019t as straightforward as one might hope. And the implications of telling parents, \u201cDon\u2019t allow screens\u201d are huge. So let\u2019s look at the data\u2014 \u00a0 The paper that\u2019s been getting all the press lately is this one\u2014a pretty cool publication that\u2019s a DTI study (brain imaging, where they look at the brain\u2019s connective pathways) of preschoolers. Which\u2014completing DTI in a bunch of preschoolers is a feat in and of itself! They found that screen time is associated with less well-developed \u201c\u2026 white matter tracts that support language, executive functions, and emergent literacy skills\u2026\u201d as well as lower scores on tests of these skills. WOW. Now that\u2019s relevant to SLPs! \u00a0 \u00a0 But not so fast. The tough thing about most research on screen time is that pretty much none of it has determined causation. Only correlation, or association. Meaning, we\u2019re not confident that screen time causes lower language or executive function skills; instead just that kids who have higher rates of screen time tend to be kids with lower skills. And that issue\u2014the inability to determine causation\u2014is true of that highly-hyped DTI study, as well as this study, this one, and almost all the studies in this recent meta-analysis. And, of the few papers that are closer to measuring the direction of the relationship, like this one, effects are significant, but not strong. Experts in this editorial state, \u201c\u2026 the association between screen time and different indicators of well-being and/or functioning is often inconsistent and, at best, small.\u201d And\u00a0another states that, \u201c\u2026the moral panic of screens is not justified.\u201d \u00a0 \u201c. . .the moral panic of screens is not justified.\u201d \u00a0 \u2013 Ophir et al., 2019 \u00a0 \u00a0 We don\u2019t want to swing too far in either direction with this. Though the research isn\u2019t conclusive, we also can\u2019t wait on better research to act, when the literature is definitely giving us warning signs about the relationship between screen time and child development. And, you know what? Scientists wish we had stronger data, too! But that\u2019s often impossible (for example, think for a moment what it would take to completely control a household\u2019s screen time, regardless of what the parents wanted\u2026 providing some kids lots of it, on purpose, and other kids none, on purpose\u2026 to measure what happens. Eeeek!). \u00a0 \u00a0 We know that speech and language exposure matter\u2014a lot. And that communicative interactions matter. And that screens could easily interfere with this. But are screens worse than other activities that disrupt communication? (We don\u2019t know.) \u00a0 And I bet all of us can think of a myriad of reasons why children with lower language, lower executive functioning, or lower cognitive skills in general may simply be more likely to be given screens, as well. \u00a0 Finally, it\u2019s important that we consider the families\u2019 perspective in this, and the implications of telling a family not to do something. Making a parent feel bad for using screens with their kids\u2014whether TV time, passing their kid the phone while they wait at the doctor\u2019s office, or allowing tablets to be part of their evening routine\u2014is not going to be healthy for the therapeutic relationship. Yet, we do have a responsibility to educate parents about concerns regarding screens, and what the AAP recommends. It\u2019s complex! See this TISLP staff member\u2019s thought-provoking thread on Twitter recently about other factors to consider, too, while helping families make sense of screen time. \u00a0 \u00a0 Adelanto-Renau, M., Moliner-Urdiales, D., Cavero-Redondo, I., Beltran-Valls, M.R., Martinez-Vizcaino, V., Alvarez-Bueno, C.
