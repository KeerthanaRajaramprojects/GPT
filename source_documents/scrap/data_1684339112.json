We discuss 14 principles and 6 ideas to help you get started with evidence-based therapy for these children, plus a free download! February 11, 2023 Download Millie is 10 months old and has a genetic syndrome that affects her motor development. She and her parents, Trish and Mike, present to your clinic for support with eating and drinking after a history of tube feeding, possible aspiration on thin fluids, and difficulty transitioning to solids. The family has recently attended an intensive therapy block where they were instructed in oral motor exercises and stretches to complete before each mealtime. Millie used to cry when Trish did the exercises, but now she just seems \u2018tuned out.\u2019 Trish is completing these exercises as instructed, but she confides that it\u2019s hard to fit them in amongst Millie\u2019s other therapies and medical procedures. Nonetheless, she and Mike are determined to leave no stone unturned. If it might help Millie, they\u2019ll do it. They want to know what you recommend to progress Millie\u2019s eating and drinking.\u00a0 The oral motor world can be a scary place for caregivers and clinicians alike. The move away from non-speech oral motor exercises (NSOMEs) in the speech world left many SLPs unsure of how to provide evidence-based assessment and treatment for motor speech and feeding difficulties. Commercial interests have jumped in to fill the gap, offering tools and trainings that claim to improve oral motor function; and while many SLPs are (rightfully) skeptical of these claims, it can be hard to find reliable information about what to do instead. Despite many decades of research, systematic reviews by Arvedson et al., Arvedson et al., Morgan et al., and Shortland et al. reported that there was little consistent, high-level evidence for any oral motor feeding intervention, aside from non-nutritive sucking for young infants.\u00a0 \u00a0 In recent years, new ideas in neuromotor intervention (for example, physical and occupational therapy research) have gained scientific support. Now, scientists and clinicians are beginning to apply these concepts to motor feeding, creating a rich source of inspiration for some of our trickiest clients. Below, we summarize some exciting ideas in neuromotor intervention and discuss how you can apply this to your work with children who have motor feeding challenges. \u00a0 \u00a0 In 2011, Professor Peter Rosenbaum proposed the F-Words of Childhood Disability, a move away from trying to \u201cfix\u201d a child\u2019s neurodisability, and towards an ICF-influenced set of 6 other \u201cf-words\u201d that should drive our intervention decisions. These new(ish) f-words are: If these ideas feel familiar, it might be because they are similar to principles from the anti-ableism and neurodiversity-affirming movements. While we\u2019re moving away from setting language and social goals for autistic children based on \u201cnormal or typical\u201d development, it remains common for \u201cnormal or typical\u201d feeding to be the aim for children with oral motor feeding challenges.\u00a0 \u00a0 Using the \u2018F-words\u2019 as our guide, we might:\u00a0 \u00a0 Researchers like Sheppard, Zimmerman et al., and Khamis et al. have recognized the value of motor learning and neural plasticity principles in pediatric feeding. Yet, in our experience, many clinicians aren\u2019t aware of these principles or don\u2019t know how to apply them. While there are many useful principles (and we recommend the linked papers above for clinicians who are interested in diving deeper) some of the most applicable principles are: \u00a0 Use It or Lose It. People who have no opportunity to learn a skill may lose the capacity to use it. This may mean you should: Age Matters. People learn more easily when they are younger than when they are older. This may mean you should: Salience Matters. People learn best when the task is rewarding and meaningful. This may mean you should: Attention and Motivation. People learn new movement skills best when they are focused on and enjoying the practice tasks. This may mean you should: Specificity. People learn faster and retain better if they practice a task that is similar to the goal, as opposed to a task that is modified compared to the goal. This may mean you should: Rehearsal Strategies. People learn best when the practice is functional. Rehearsal tasks are ways of practicing that are not functional. Simulation is pretending to complete the task; fractionalization means practicing part of the task in isolation; segmentation means working on sequential parts of the task separately and then joining them together; and simplification means reducing the difficulty of the task. This may mean you should: Goal Complexity. People learn most efficiently when the practice task is as complex as the child is able to achieve with support. Practicing a whole task rather than breaking it into parts is likely to be most effective. This may mean you should: Implicit Learning. People learn more effectively when they learn a skill by doing it (with modifications as needed) and experience the outcome for themselves rather than being explicitly taught the movements required for a task. This may mean you should: Practice Amount Matters/Repetition Matters. People learn better if they practice a lot. This may mean you should: Massed vs. Distributed Practice/Intensity Matters. People acquire a skill better if they first practice many times all in a row, and then generalize it better if they practice spread over a longer time period. This may mean you should: Random Practice. People learn best when multiple targets are worked on randomly. This may mean you should: Variable Practice. People learn best when the context of practice varies. This may mean you should: Extrinsic feedback. People learn better when they receive external feedback that is intermittent (not constant), delayed (not immediate), and focused on the results (not the performance). A brief period of more frequent, knowledge-of-performance feedback might be helpful in the early stages of learning a new skill. This may mean you should: Transfer of Learning. People\u2019s learning is most useful when they can take a skill and apply it to their daily lives. This is also referred to as generalization. This may mean you should: Phew! We know this might feel overwhelming, especially if you're new to shaping your therapy around these principles. To *ahem* simplify the task of applying these principles, you might begin by considering only the principles specific to different clinical questions, like this: And if you don't have it all memorized yet, don't worry! You can download our printable chart to help you apply the principles of neuroplasticity to these clinical questions mid-session. Just be sure to laminate it to protect it from enthusiastic clients! \u00a0 \u00a0 A common theme across multiple principles of motor learning and neural plasticity is that children will likely learn best when their practice involves real food and mealtimes, especially when those mealtimes are enjoyable and interesting. Attempting to build skills or strength using tools or exercises divorced from functional eating/drinking scenarios may not result in efficient or effective motor learning in comparison, and is likely to be harder to transfer into functional activities. \u00a0 A common question is whether tools and exercises should be used if children are extremely aversive or not safe for oral intake. For children that are extremely aversive, using motor learning principles around attention and motivation might mean starting with goals that optimize the child\u2019s comfort and enjoyment around mealtimes rather than a goal, for example, of increasing jaw strength. After all, if a child has an extreme aversion to foods or mealtimes, is the primary concern how strong they are? An aspiring acrobat might build up their body strength in the gym, but as long as they\u2019re petrified of heights, their strength can\u2019t do them any good on the high wire. Building mealtime comfort also has functional implications\u2014it may allow a child to join their family and friends at mealtimes or celebrations, even if they don\u2019t eat yet.\u00a0 \u00a0 For the very small minority of children not safe for any oral intake, mouthing and chewing on non-food objects may be helpful (as it is for a typically-developing child), but motor learning principles suggest that we should encourage intrinsic motivation and attention\u2014for example, by supporting mouthing in child-directed play and exploration. There is no evidence that purpose-sold \u2018special needs\u2019 products are superior to mainstream teethers, toys, or child-safe tableware and household items for this purpose. These products may, however, be reasonably used for children who are oral sensory seekers, and who are intrinsically motivated to seek and enjoy the specific types of sensory input provided by different mouthing toys. \u00a0 It is unlikely, based on motor learning research, that passive stretches, massage, or \u2018stimulation\u2019 will improve motor skills or oral musculature in children who eat and/or drink. Further, forcing or coercing children to accept unwanted and non-functional oral stimuli, such as intra-oral massage, undercuts intrinsic motivation and violates bodily autonomy. Claims that these activities \u2018wake up the mouth\u2019 do not have a strong scientific premise. (There is some evidence that oral sensorimotor stimulation may be helpful for preterm infants in the NICU, possibly because it provides sensory input in an environment of relative sensory deprivation. The same mechanism does not make sense for older children with oral motor difficulties, who are in a similar sensory environment to their same-age peers.) \u00a0 \u00a0 These principles don\u2019t provide a \u2018program\u2019 or \u2018manual\u2019 for treatment of motor feeding issues\u2014but since when did any client come with a manual? If there were a cookbook approach to treating clients, our job wouldn\u2019t require a master's degree. It takes careful clinical reasoning and critical thinking to apply concepts from neurodisability research to our assessment, goal-setting, and intervention. But in the hands of a skilled and thoughtful SLP, these principles could result in motor feeding interventions that are more efficient, effective, meaningful, and client- and family-centered. Now, that\u2019s something to chew on.\u00a0 \u00a0 First, you validate the commitment that Millie\u2019s family has shown in seeking out feeding therapy and following through so assiduously on home practice tasks. You explain that there isn\u2019t yet adequate scientific evidence to demonstrate an effect of passive exercises on feeding function (but acknowledge that some families want to try them out, and that\u2019s reasonable). You then explain that evidence from motor intervention research suggests that motor therapies are most likely to be effective when they are meaningful, specific, and contextualized. So, you want to focus on developing fun and family bonding at mealtimes and then set other goals based on feeding functions that are important to Millie and her family\u2014like drinking safely and enjoying family foods. To start with: When you ask for Trish and Mike\u2019s thoughts, Trish smiles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound that different from how my sister feeds her kids.\u201d Mike leans forward. \u201cDo you think Millie could be part of my family\u2019s Sunday dinners?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s work out how to make that happen,\u201d you reply.
