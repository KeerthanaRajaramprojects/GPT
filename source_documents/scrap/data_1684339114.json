Learn more below. Scouts Search the science We search hundreds of journals each month, reading an average of 3k abstracts, and narrow that down to what might be relevant for SLPs. Writers Read the science, then write up what\u2019s useful From stacks of around 200\u2013400 journal articles monthly, each writer reads 10\u201320 papers. They then write up (or review) any research that will be clinically actionable for SLPs. Topic Area Experts Ensure accuracy We consult with topic area experts (usually internal, sometimes external) to ensure the accuracy of the writer\u2019s work. Editors Ensure quality Editors help the writers make sure their reviews are straightforward and easy-to-read. Scientists Confirm accuracy of our work Editors contact the original journal article authors, so that they can provide input and help ensure that we\u2019re accurately reporting their research. Voice artists Record audio All written reviews are recorded by our audio staff so that you can listen to reviews on the go. Cartoonists Create research art Staff artists create cartoons to help make reviews memorable or easier to understand. Editors Create supplemental resources We want implementation to be as easy as possible. So when there\u2019s opportunities to create charts, calculators, or printable resources for you, we do it!  You Know what works! We publish the reviews, and you get to stay up-to-date on the evidence, without the stress.

We publish the reviews, and you get to stay up-to-date on the evidence, without the stress. Journal articles communicate the science; we translate these articles for clinical practice. Because SLPs and scientists need different content, organized in different ways. Here\u2019s how we organize our content: Review/Brief Perspective/Tutorial Ask TISLP Editorial We don\u2019t just read some of the science; we read all of the science that\u2019s relevant to speech\u2013language pathologists. The following journals are scouted monthly by our team: A B C D\u2013E F\u2013H I J\u2013Jo Jo\u2013Jo Jo\u2013M N\u2013P Q\u2013Z Acta Paediatrica Activities, Adaptation, and Aging Advances in Neonatal care\u00a0 AERA Open Age and Ageing Aging and Mental Health Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition ALTER \u2013 European Journal of Disability Research Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders Alzheimer's and Dementia American Annals of the Deaf American Educational Research Journal American Journal of Gastroenterology American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry American Journal of Occupational Therapy American Journal of Otolaryngology American Journal of Perinatology American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation American Journal of Speech Language Pathology American Journal on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities American Sociological Review Annals of Biomedical Engineering Annals of Dyslexia Annals of Long-Term Care Annals of Otology, Rhinology and Laryngology Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Annual Review of Psychology Aphasiology Appetite Applied Linguistics Applied Psycholinguistics Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Assessment for Effective Intervention Augmentative and Alternative Communication Auris Nasus Larynx Australian Journal of Education Autism Autism and Developmental Language Impairments Autism Research NEXT \u00a0\u00a0 All journals were added to our list via one or more of the following methods: So do you review ALL the articles published in each of these journals, every month? Once TISLP points me toward an article I should read, how do I get the full-text article? The reviews describe original research. How do I know that the research is interpreted correctly? What are your quality control procedures? What if I have questions or input regarding your procedures?
