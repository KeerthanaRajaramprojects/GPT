I love how the article summaries are broken down into accessible terms and include takeaways that I can immediately use in my practice. So very grateful for this resource! Briana R, MS, CCC-SLP Private Practice SLP TISLP has been an amazing way for me to continue to be informed on current research and best practices, while maintaining my busy SLP schedule. As the lead of the speech department at a private practice, I can feel confident that I am helping my own clients and the clients of the SLPs that I supervise have the best clinical outcomes. Amanda Mahler, MA, CCC-SLP Midland County ESA As a busy, traveling special ed SLP, time for CE and learning about new best practices in our field is hard to come by. TISLP is a lifesaver.

I am implementing new EBP with every student\u2013 without weekend journal reading! Hannah, MA, CCC-SLP Hinds County Schools It is a reminder to do a monthly check-in about why I am doing what I am doing.  As I listen to reviews, I think through my caseload and what I need to modify, scrap, or re-energize.  Sometimes the reviews are exactly what I needed and sometimes it inspires me to dig deeper about a new question. Hailey Pedersen, MS, CCC-SLP Early Childhood SLP It makes the research easily and quickly digestible. I feel like I\u2019m more able to practice at the top of the license now that I\u2019m staying current on the research.

Melissa, MS, CCC-SLP Outpatient Pediatric SLP I feel so much more confident explaining to parents and colleagues why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. I have research to back up my treatment and have clear examples and ways to phrase explanations. I love saving posts where I learned something new (or what I could be doing better!) and referencing them over and over again. Samantha DiNello, MA, CCC-SLP Early Intervention SLP I bought a subscription right out of grad school because I wanted to stay up to date on EBP. I love knowing that I can search anything SLP related and find easy to digest, relevant, AND evidence-based help! I use this subscription on a regular basis to check myself.

Samantha DiNello, MA, CCC-SLP Early Intervention SLP The mission of The Informed SLP is to connect clinicians and scientists with each other\u2019s work. And while the primary responsibility of knowledge brokers is to translate and share information accurately for the people who need it, we believe that a secondary responsibility of our company is to leave our field better than we found it. Ultimately, our presence in the SLP community means we also have a responsibility to it. In recognition of this, we consistently and wholeheartedly commit to generosity, reciprocity, and respect for the SLPs, clients, and scientists we serve.
