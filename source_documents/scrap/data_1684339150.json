After graduating from Penn State, Amanda worked for several years as an SLP in school, home, and medical settings.\u00a0 She has presented on AAC-related topics st ASHA, an IEE Electrical Safety Workshop, and at the AAC in the Cloud Conference. Amanda hopes to continue sharing her knowledge and experiences about AAC through her blog, AAC is where it\u2019s AT. Today, she introduces us to a series of posts that focus on creating fun AACtivities for language learning. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Back-to-School with AAC: Putting the FUN back in FUNctional There is something special about this time of year \u2013 students are trying on their back-to-school outfits, school supplies are magically discounted beyond belief, and parents are crying tears of joy at the thought of sending their children back to school for the next ten months! As an SLP working in the schools, I still get that same excited, happily anxious feeling in my stomach just before starting back. After sorting through the Target Dollar Spot, getting my desk organized, and attempting draft 1 of 5738 of my schedule, it\u2019s time to get my therapy plans going! The questions is\u2026 how do I get started?? This article is Part 1 of 5 to help you get Back-to-School with AAC!\u00a0Today, we\u2019re looking at putting the FUN back in FUNctional. What exactly does that mean? School societies (SLPs included) are highly data-driven. This isn\u2019t a bad thing \u2013 data is very important for us to understand a student\u2019s baseline and demonstrate progress. However, in order to achieve progress, we must provide effective and efficient instruction! This can and will look different for each student. However, it\u2019s very important that we as educators do not fall into the trap of continually testing our students, rather than teaching. This means that we must provide enriching, engaging experiences for students to learn through, rather than matching answers to questions on a worksheet. ALL students need to be able to learn in a fun and creative way before being tested on their knowledge. This is especially true for those using something complex and complicated like AAC. It\u2019s vital that all areas of language are being taught in a fun, hands-on approach to the greatest extent possible. \u00a0According to Dr. Karyn Purvis, \u201c\u2026it takes approximately 400 repetitions to create a new synapse in the brain unless it\u2019s done in play, in which case it takes between 10-20 repetitions.\u201d While each child is different and unique, we know that research supports play- and relationship-based therapy interventions (e.g., Koegel & Koegel, 2006; Greenspan, Weider, & Simons, 1998)  I\u2019ve seen this in my own therapy session many, many times. When a skill is presented in a drill format, the scenario is often contrived, the student is typically bored, and generalization of the skill can be difficult. However, when the skill is built into a fun, motivating activity, participation typically requires significantly less prompting and generalization of the skill the target skill takes less time. Here\u2019s what it looks like in my therapy sessions. I was working with a kindergarten student on the core words \u201chere\u201d and \u201cwhere.\u201d This activity could have easily been targeted with a printed activity from the internet by matching questions with their answers (i.e., \u201cWhere is the sun? It\u2019s here in the sky.\u201d). However, that\u2019s one quick activity that difficult to expand upon, tough to generalize, and leaves both the student and SLP bored, frustrated, and with 28 minutes left of therapy! Instead, we took a simple book, \u2018Where\u2019s Spot?\u2019 and made several great activities based off of it.  After just two days of reading the book with adult modeling and playing hide-and-seek with the core vocabulary, the student began to read the book to me using the targeted core words!! How\u2019s that for progress? Try to jump into the mindset of someone the age of your student. Not sure how to get started? Well, if you\u2019re working with a 6-year-old student, ask another 6-year-old what they like to do for fun! Check out the kids on the playground \u2013 what\u2019s entertaining? Check in with your OT and PT. Can you involve sensory and/or motor activities? Utilizing movement is another great opportunity for the student to make generalizations with vocabulary. Plus, sensory and motor experiences tend to be highly motivating! You can also check out fabulous resources on the internet, such as Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and more. Here are some personal suggestions: In summary:\u00a0When working with kids, it\u2019s vital to become one yourself. If they\u2019re having fun, the learning will follow. Play. Laugh. Model. Laugh some more.\u00a0Until next time, Amanda ML Samperi, MS, CCC-SLP Founder of AAC is where it\u2019s AT References: ASHA. Spoken Language Disorders.

Is there a citation for that Karyn Purvis quote? Hi Taylor! In regards to the Karyn Purvis quote, there is not a direct citation, as the post containing this quote from Court Appointed Special Advocates\u00ae has since been taken down. According to the Texas Christian University, it is believed that Dr. Purvis said this quote at a training, not directly in her research. Unfortunately, she passed away shortly after that training.  Her research is very powerful in using play to connect with children, especially those in neglected, abusive, or otherwise difficult situations (please visit https://child.tcu.edu/#sthash.997Oaugh.dpbs for more information). I think the Dr. Purvis quote can be used anecdotally to give one researcher\u2019s perspective on vocabulary acquisition during play. However, I would not cite the data in this quotation as bottom line. For more concrete and research-based citations, please see the examples listed at the end of that paragraph  (e.g., Koegel & Koegel, 2006; Greenspan, Weider, & Simons, 1998) or consult the ASHA portal. Taylor, I\u2019m not familiar with Purvis\u2019 work, but I have seen the same point made by others e.g., Desautels https://www.butler.edu/file/299194/download Your email address will not be published.
