In this post, we welcome back Matthew Baud and Jill Senner to talk about how they are using this assessment tool. Enjoy! AAC evaluations can be challenging, especially if there is disagreement among team members as to whether AAC is necessary or not.\u00a0 We frequently see disagreements about AAC arise when a student is able to speak.\u00a0 Let\u2019s examine the following case. Mrs. Brown has had Johnny in her class for the last 2 years and\u00a0she \u201cunderstands everything\u201d he is saying during their routine calendar time.\u00a0 The new SLP, who only sees Johnny once weekly for 30 minutes, tried to elicit information about his weekend at home and reported that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand anything.\u201d What is going on here? \u00a0How can two communication partners have such vastly different experiences with the same student?\u00a0 Who is right and who is wrong?\u00a0 Actually, both reports are true!\u00a0 Extrinsic factors such as partner familiarity and known versus unknown context can have a significant impact on speech comprehensibility (i.e., how well the student\u2019s message is understood).\u00a0 The Index of Augmented Speech Comprehensibility in Children (I-ASCC), developed by Dr. Patricia Dowden (1997), is a valuable tool that we frequently use to help teams resolve similar conflicts and develop effective speech-supplementation strategies for students who speak. The I-ASCC is a non-standardized clinical measure to determine single-word speech comprehensibility in children (Dowden, 1997). \u00a0Children are shown picture stimuli and their answers are recorded. Familiar and unfamiliar communication partners then listen to the recorded samples with unknown and known contexts. The following is a video clip of a child taking the I-ASCC. \u00a0First watch the video without knowing any contexts.\u00a0 Write down the words you think he is saying.  Now, watch the video again but first download and review this list of context cues.\u00a0 When you are finished, download the answer key\u00a0and see how well you did. As an unfamiliar communication partner, you probably didn\u2019t understand as much as someone who knows him well but you probably did better with context known than when you listened without! \u00a0This instrument yields quantitative data regarding how well familiar and unfamiliar communication partners understand a child with and without context. Because this tool was described in a research article and it isn\u2019t yet commercially available, it took us a while to assemble. \u00a0Since we have already spent the time to put the materials together, we have made the files available for sharing so you too can take advantage of this helpful resource.\u00a0 Instructions, record forms, and stimulus pictures in Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) and SymbolStixs can be found on our AAC Assessment Pinterest board\u00a0or by clicking on the image below.  We look forward to Dr. Dowden releasing an electronic version of the instrument in the future.\u00a0 \u00a0Until then, break out the scissors, glue and note cards!

This is amazing!  Just what my team has been needing to provide the best help for a student.  Thank you!!! I followed the link to Pinterest and found the pin but it does not link to any handouts\u2026..clicking on the image did not work either, thanks Sue, I have reached out to the authors to try to get a direct link to it. I will post it here when they respond. Sorry for the inconvenience. Sue, here is the direct link to the zipped file that you can download: http://www.talcaac.com/IASCC%20Share.zip I tried to download this and my computer warned that it has a potential virus or spyware. Has anyone else tried to download it? Hi Jane, I am working with the authors of the post on this. It may be a setting on your computer that gives that alert whenever zip files are being downloaded. In any event, we are working on an alternative pathway to ensure safe file downloads. That should be available in a few days. Sorry for the inconvenience. Thanks to Dr. Senner & Matthew Baud for sharing this! I had a post-it note hanging in my cubicle for literally a year reminding me to figure out/create materials for Index of Augmented Speech Comprehensibility in Children. It was a tool I\u2019d read about but couldn\u2019t find a finished product, so to speak. Thanks for taking the time to create these materials! I have several students in mind for this tool. Rachael Langley Thanks for sharing Dr. Senner & Matthew Baud. Your resource will be helpful. Wondering if the electronic version ever surfaced? Your email address will not be published.
