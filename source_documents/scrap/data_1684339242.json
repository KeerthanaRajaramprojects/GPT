They\u2019ve been incredibly generous in sharing resources from their AT Recipes for Success project (you can view previous posts here). As a member of the AT Core team, Sara\u00a0is involved in\u00a0AAC evaluations and therapy in the hospital\u2019s clinics, out-patient program and Transitional Care Unit.\u00a0CHoR\u2019s AT Program is one of few comprehensive AT programs in Central Virginia. The program provides AT evaluations, equipment and training to people of all ages, enabling children and adults with disabilities to function more independently.\u00a0 CHoR\u2019s AT team consists of four SLPs, two OTs, one PT, and one Therapy Practice Assistant.\u00a0 In addition to completing transdiciplinary evaluations and treatments, CHoR\u2019s AT team is responsible for supporting staff and sharing AT information to five CHoR therapy centers throughout Central Virginia. Today\u2019s post is the first of several in which Sara and her colleagues share parent resources for interactive storybook reading and follow-up activities. Enjoy!  Shared reading is a fun (and important) activity that many children who use communication systems enjoy, but may have difficulty accessing linguistically.\u00a0 As the child of former pre-school teacher and librarian, my therapy shelves are teeming with books and related activities.\u00a0 As I began to see more and more users of AAC for on-going therapy, reading children\u2019s books provided great opportunities for thinking outside of the box with core vocabulary.\u00a0 While modeling MORE in Bear Wants More came pretty naturally; using words like GET OUT with Bark George required a little more creative thought.  In addition to procuring grant funding for our AT \u201cRecipes for Success\u201d program, our hospital has a separate grant-funded program called \u201cReady Set Read!\u201d\u00a0 This program provides a children\u2019s book with associated language activity created by an SLP, fine motor activity created by an OT, and gross motor activity created by a PT.\u00a0 The books and activities are provided to families after shared reading is modeled in the therapy session.\u00a0 The major goals of the program are to encourage literacy development activities at home and to promote carryover of therapy goals.\u00a0 \u201cReady, Set, Read\u201d allows clinicians to model specific skills with the book or materials in a session, coach the caregiver to demonstrate those skills in the session, and then practice at home with the exact same materials.\u00a0 While this program was not initially designed for users of AAC, we have recently modified the language activity sheet for four books to match the layout of AT \u201cRecipes for Success.\u201d\u00a0 The modified layout provides vocabulary to use during book reading as well as during completion of the crafts so that families of verbal and augmented kiddos alike can have fun sharing books!  Core Language Recipes, fine motor, and gross motor activities for several books. In this post, you can download the materials for\u00a0Bear Wants More.\u00a0 Have fun talking and reading!  Stay tuned for materials for additional books \u2013 Bark, George,\u00a0Pete the Cat Rockin\u2019 in My School Shoes.\u00a0Sometimes I Feel Sunny\u00a0\u2013 in future posts. \u00a0 Filed under: Featured Posts, PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: downloads, handouts, parents, shared reading This post was written by Carole Zangari TELL ME About It: AAC Learning with \u2018The Skin You Live In\u2019!
