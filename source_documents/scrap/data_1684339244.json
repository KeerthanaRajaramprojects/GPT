A number of common threads emerged through comments like these. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating! My student would make SO much more progress if there was carryover at home.\u201d \u201cI keep telling my student\u2019s parents this but they don\u2019t really follow through.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told them about the research and shared a lot of web links with them, but nothing seems to change.\u00a0My student\u2019s family still doesn\u2019t really use his AAC at home.\u201d \u201cThe family tells me that they are modeling AAC, but when I look at the \u2018history\u2019 it shows that not much AAC is happening outside of school hours.\u201d In person and through social media, professionals have shared their stories and expressed that they are sometimes surprised and puzzled but mostly disappointed...

Sara and her colleagues\u00a0at Children\u2019s Hospital of Richmond at VCU (CHoR) are generously sharing some of the resources they created to help families implement AAC at home. Through\u00a0CHoR\u2019s AT Program,\u00a0one of few comprehensive AT programs in Central Virginia, a series of parent-friendly handouts were created to help families in\u00a0Central Virginia facilitate core vocabulary learning by their young children.\u00a0In the final post, we get to play with dolls and beach balls.

Connecting with them on Facebook. Here are some of the most active AAC-related groups out there. 1. Speak for Yourself Users Group\u00a0(Despite it\u2019s name, this one is not limited to families/professionals who use SFY.) 2. AAC: Alternative Awesome Communicators 3. Angelman, Literacy, and Education\u00a0(Despite the name, the content is very applicable to a broad range of developmental disabilities.) 4.

There can be a dynamic tension between the things we would like them to do to maximize the AAC learning process and what they can realistically accomplish given the competing demands of their busy lives. We really believe that having families do more AAC at home will enhance the communication learning, though I\u2019m not really sure that we have evidence to back up that belief. Nevertheless, we push for it. Nicely, of course. But we push. On a good day, it all works out. Or, at least it seems to. But does it really? Here are some things we\u2019ve been thinking about. Each family has their own culture. Some families are highly structured, others are more spontaneous, and a few are downright chaotic. Whatever their nature, it is who they are and how they operate.
