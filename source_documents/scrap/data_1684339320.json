We have the best outcomes when the interventionist knows a variety of strategies that can support the learning outcomes.\u00a0We\u2019ve written about implementing countdown boards and other visual supports to build attention in the past, and have been gratified to hear from many of you who utilize those strategies. In today\u2019s post, SLP Kimberly Scanlon, owner of Scanlon Speech Therapy, discusses how she implements this strategy and shares her own clever variation. You can download it at the end of the post. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: You plan the session. In fact, you over-plan and over prepare. You carefully select materials ensuring they are appropriate, engaging, and motivating for the client. Each activity will be short. Short is key as this student grows restless and losses interest rather quickly. You remove most of the distractors (can\u2019t remove the fan or the light switch) to ensure that he will focus on this amazing game meticulously designed with some inspiration from Pinterest, of course. The moment comes and the student arrives. He. Is. Engaged. Yay!! 5 minutes and several turns pass and you sense it. He is beginning to lose interest. His attention is waning. Panic sets in. What do you do? Options: Ah, but there are more options. Here\u2019s one that involves 2 things: Setting clear expectations helps to decrease frustration and inattention. When there is an understanding of what to do and knowledge of when a task or activity will end, the child can anticipate the conclusion. And, when the child knows when an activity concludes, he or she will more likely spend his or her time attending to the task at hand. Before you sense the child is losing interest, tell and show the child how much more you want him or her to accomplish, participate, or do. Set clear expectations by telling the child: Pediatric speech therapist, Laura Mize, is a believer in this strategy and calls it \u201cThe One More Rule\u201d. Many children, though, need more than the verbal explanation to get it. This is when visuals or mini-schedules come in handy. Recently, I completed an AMAZING online workshop titled, Visual Systems: Practical Communication Supports by speech language pathologist, Lorraine Maida. I HIGHLY recommend it if you\u2019re interested in learning more about how to use visuals to support language learning with your students, clients, children. In her presentation, she shared so many nuggets of wisdom including: \u201cWhen a child has more information he or she will be more cooperative.\u201d \u201cLess talk and more showing.\u201d \u201cAlways start with the end in mind.\u201d After completing Maida\u2019s workshop, I turned on my computer and made the following visuals:  I made a One More visual, a Two More visual, and a Three More visual. The Two and Three More visuals were designed for my clients with stronger attention spans.\u00a0 For instance, if we\u2019re playing a game and I sense that the client is becoming restless, I\u2019ll take out the visual and say, \u201cYou\u2019ll take 3 more turns and then put the game away.\u201d I use the One More visual with my toddlers or clients who struggle to stay on task for short periods or quickly move from task to task. \u00a0If I say, \u201cLet\u2019s do one more\u201d, I simultaneously show the child the visual while saying the command. For instance, if we are doing a puzzle and he sees something else that strikes his fancy, I will say, \u201cLet\u2019s do one more piece\u201d and show my visual. Laminating the visuals allows me to use a marker and make an X or check mark after completion. So far, this visual system has worked well for me.\u00a0 I intend to improve it by shrinking each visual to the size of a standard index card, joining all three together with a key chain ring and, attaching them to lanyard. I\u2019ll end with one piece of advice\u2026 If you promise the task will be completed in one, two, or three turns then keep your promise and end the task. As a clinician or parent it\u2019s tempting to keep it going and going and going but don\u2019t make yourself into a liar! If you keep your word, the child will really believe you when you say, \u201cJust one more!\u201d Click here to download my visuals for your own use. \u00a0If you have more ideas, please comment below!!
