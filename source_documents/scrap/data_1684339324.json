Mauro gets frustrated when the clinician presents new activities. Brianna starts to bang the table when demands are placed on her. Zach becomes\u00a0agitated when he has to wait for something he wants.\n\u2013 Like any set of tools and strategies, AAC works best when the communicator is relaxed, confident, and engaged. Our July Strategy of the Month focuses on PrAACtical Supports for Behavior. We hope to share ideas for planning therapy sessions that help AAC learners stay focused, calm, and engaged.\n\u2014\nWe\u2019re big believers in the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, what can we do to prevent or minimize problems like the ones experienced by Rachel, Mauro, Brianna, and Zach? The answers have to do with having clear and appropriate expectations, and using visual and AAC supports effectively. When used consistently, these strategies can help cut down or even eliminate some of the obstacles that prevent our AAC friends from being ready to engage and learn.\n\u2013\nThis week, we focus on transition supports. Change is not easy for any of us, but for some people with AAC needs it is harder than for the rest of us. We\u2019ve written before about transition tips, but here are some more thoughts on supporting people through change and transition.\n\u2013\nBefore the Transition\nFor us, the move to a new activity in a therapy session or the switch from one place to another is no big deal. That\u2019s because we have a good understanding of our day as a whole, know that the \u2018new\u2019 thing is not bad, and have the power to use communication to protest, complain, or negotiate. Take those away from us, and we\u2019d be on edge, too. Preparing them can include: \u2013\nDuring the Transition\nOnce it\u2019s time for the transition to occur, we can continue to support them with a few other strategies. Focusing on those options may be just enough to help her maintain control of her emotions so that we can continue in our play and learning. Other kinds of choices can help as well. Having a little control goes a long way and can help ease the transition from one activity to the next. \u2013\nAfter the Transition\nOnce the transition has been made, it\u2019s usually best to move quickly along with the new activity. Yes, there may be some reluctance or hesitation, but move along in spite of it. Engaging the learner in the activity is, in most cases, the best way to minimize problems. Make the activity easy at the beginning and boost the \u2018fun factor.\u2019 It\u2019s tempting to stop and try to resolve any negativity, but, in our experience that leads further down the path of resistance. We\u2019ve have had much better luck trying to skip on down happy street, even if our partner is a bit reluctant.\n\u2013\nOnce some time has passed, then we can revisit the experience and put words to what happened, using aided language input, of course. It\u2019s great to review this with the learner, and using it as an occasion to highlight success to a teacher or caregiver is a bonus.\n\u201cJudah, I was proud of you today. You liked bubbles a lot. You didn\u2019t want to stop. But when it was done, you did puzzles. That was fun. I\u2019m glad we did puzzles together.\u201d\n\u201cSierra did a great job today, Mrs. Jones. Sierra, I want to tell your teacher how well you waited for our iPad time. You knew that first we do writing and games, then we play on the iPad. Mrs. Jones, you should be proud of how well Sierra waited for her favorite thing.\u201d\n\u2013\nNext week, we\u2019ll continue on the theme of behavioral supports by considering how we use the physical environment to promote a \u2018ready to learn\u2019 state of mind. In the meantime, we\u2019d love to hear your favorite strategies for using communication to support learning and behavior.\n\u2013 Filed under: Strategy of the Month Tagged With: aided language input, ASD, behavior, countdown board, developmental disability, first then, intervention, picture schedule, positive behavior support, transition, visual supports This post was written by Carole Zangari 30 PrAACtical Ideas for Celebrating Autism Awareness and Acceptance Month TELL ME About It: AAC Learning with \u2018It\u2019s Okay to Be Different!\u2019 Growing AAC Professionals: Resources for Mythbusters Video of the Week: Visuals, Timers, & Zoom Thanks for this \u2013 I\u2019m working through it now.
