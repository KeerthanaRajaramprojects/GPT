Why? Because it probably means that the students aren\u2019t really using them. We cheer when we see schedules that are rumpled and dog-eared, not shiny. Show me a battered and tattered visual schedule, and I\u2019ll show you one that gets used every day. Sadly, that\u2019s not always the case. \u2013 The bridge between having a visual schedule and consistently using it is one that many learners don\u2019t seem to cross. Here are some of our ideas for helping your AAC learners to the other side. \u2013 1. Have a plan to teach the schedule. If you are working one-on-one with a learner, you can easily implement the schedule and get them using it with most-to-least prompting. If you\u2019re working with a group or a classroom, consider staggered implementation. Teaching 12 beginners...

We love the idea of alerting students to an upcoming change by incorporating that within the daily schedule. \u2013 Take a look. \u2013 Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: visual schedule March 17, 2012\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\tLeave your thoughts When people think about visual schedules, they tend to think about a classroom schedule with PCS for each major activity of \u00a0the day. These are great and we look for them whenever we do classroom visits. In this post, we hope to inspire some of you to use other types of visual schedules as well. We haven\u2019t quite worked out the right terms for these (and we welcome your suggestions) but, conceptually we know that there are three main levels of visual schedules. Each level conveys information about what is happening in a specific segment of time. \u2013 At the Calendar Level, the schedule represents what\u2019s happening throughout the month and/or week. \u2013 At the Schedule Level, we\u2019re representing the events of a particular day, a portion of a day, or a session (or class period). \u2013 At the Task Level, the schedule reflects discrete steps of an activity or...

Some of the people we evaluated had real issues with this and so we\u2019ve experimented with ways to make the testing less stressful and more productive. Here are some of the strategies that we found to be most successful. \u2013 1. Work with the team to establish Fair Testing Practices for the person you\u2019ll be evaluating. Our chapter on \u2018Language Assessment for Students Who Use AAC\u2019 describes this in more detail, but essentially it involves writing a \u2018rule book\u2019 for how to test this person. It might specify how long the test session can/should be, how to set up the situation so the person can respond, and what other supports are needed so that we are testing the person\u2019s...

Some of our AAC\u00a0friends have had great success with object schedules, so\u00a0we\u2019re\u00a0a little surprised that more people\u00a0don\u2019t use them. Here\u2019s a nice video on the strategy from the wonderful team at OCALI. \u00a0 Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: visual schedule March 10, 2012\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\tLeave your thoughts It\u2019s Spring Break here in Florida and that makes us think of traveling. Traveling is never easy, but people who use AAC don\u2019t let that stop them. Here are some tips for making travel easier. \u2013 1. Prepare with a social story. There are some great ones available online, like this one from Autisable (downloadable version here) and . Books and narratives about travelling, such as this one from Kids Can Dream, can also be helpful. Keep the visual element strong by downloading travel brochures for places you will visit, looking at images together, or watching online videos of your destination. \u2013 2. Put it on the (visual) calendar. If you have a monthly or weekly calendar, add symbols to for the trip. Look at the calendar together to talk about it, what you\u2019ll be doing, etc. Doing this repeatedly, can ease the transition into this new territory. Consider doing...

The process of deciding which one to use begins with two questions: What is the purpose of this particular visual schedule? How will it be used? Both of these drive the decisions you make about which format to use. If my primary purpose in making the visual schedule is to help a student become more independent in following the steps in a task, and I know the person is going to be seated at a desk while doing this, I may choose a horizontal layout that shows the sequence. Because it is a school-aged child and we are activity working on literacy skills, I consider a stationary format on the desk surface that has the student use a check-off system. Having the student cross out or check off the steps as they are completed, gives authentic practice with writing skills. On the...
