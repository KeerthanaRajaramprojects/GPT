Today, we feature SLPs Kate Grandbois and Amy Wonkka who share their approach to aided language modeling. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Bringing it all Together:\u00a0 Aided Language Modeling Most SLPs working in AAC have come across a variety of different interventions in their practice.\u00a0 Some, like aided language modeling, are popular and commonly seen at conferences. They are the most popular option on the intervention buffet.\u00a0 Others, like discrete trial training, are like the mystery meat \u2013 you think you know what it is, you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like it, and you\u2019re going to watch while someone else tries it first. Sometimes these teaching procedures are straightforward, and sometimes they are confusing, intimidating, or complicated.\u00a0 You may find that choosing which intervention to use is influenced by your goals, your workplace norms, or the direct needs of the AAC user; but when it comes down to actually implementing that intervention it can feel like a very complicated experience.\u00a0 What is the intervention supposed to look like? What materials should I use? What goals are going to be supported by this intervention?\u00a0 How am I possibly going to take data on this while I\u2019m also trying to do therapy?\u00a0\u00a0 Our goal for this series is to demystify some of the items in the intervention buffet and give a \u201chow to\u201d for implementation.\u00a0 We will touch on a wide variety of interventions seen in AAC, including aided language modeling, prompting procedures / prompt fading, incidental teaching vs discrete trial training, and finally shaping.\u00a0 First item on the buffet: Aided Language Modeling First, what is it? Aided modeling interventions encompass a range of somewhat similar approaches that involve a communication partner providing some degree of input to an augmented communicator using an aided method.\u00a0 Aided modeling interventions are effective, evidence-based, and are becoming a common recommendation in the field of AAC (to learn more about the evidence and literature behind ALM you can listen to our episode on this).\u00a0\u00a0 It can go by a variety of different names, including SAL, or system for augmenting language (Sevcik et. al. 1995), augmented input (Romski & Sevcik, 2003), aided language stimulation (Goossens\u2019, 1989), aided language modeling (Drager et. al, 2006), AAC Modeling (Sennott, Light, & McNaughton, 2016), and natural aided language (Cafiero, 2001) to name a few.\u00a0 Bottom line: aided language modeling is a popular AAC intervention strategy that is evidence-based, but has a lot of individual variation depending on personal experience, setting, and AAC user goals. So, any time I use the device to model, I\u2019m providing ALM \u2013 right?\u00a0 Well, maybe.\u00a0 In their systematic review of the research, Sennott, Light, and McNaughton (2016) make this distinction between AAC modeling and instructional modeling: The goal is that the adult \u201cmodels\u201d the expressive use of the child\u2019s AAC system. AAC modeling is differentiated from instructional modeling, in that in instructional modeling the teacher models an instructional target. With AAC modeling, the teacher uses the AAC system in the context of a naturalistic communication interaction. A naturalistic communication interaction is defined as a \u201cdynamic process between at least two people\u00a0which is highly interactive, bi-directional, and multi-modal\u201d (Kraat, 1985, p. 21) and\u00a0occurs naturally in the context of the learner\u2019s day (p. 2). When you are thinking about introducing ALM strategies into your work, be sure to think about naturalistic communication exchanges that occur throughout your session or the client\u2019s day.\u00a0 What types of things are they very interested in?\u00a0 What routines happen frequently?\u00a0 An awareness of these functional and naturalistic opportunities is important when integrating ALM into a treatment approach.\u00a0 Consider the importance of modeling within naturalistic exchanges \u2013 particularly those that are engaging and meaningful for your client \u2013 and finding opportunities to model a range of pragmatic functions (perhaps all with the same small set of vocabulary words) within those opportunities. How do I use it?\u00a0 What does the intervention look like? This is a great question \u2013 and the answer differs.\u00a0 Generally speaking, any intervention that involves aided language modeling will include some component of a communication partner providing input to an augmented communicator using something external to / other than their body (for a review of aided vs unaided communication methods, listen to our episode on AAC Basics and Terminology).\u00a0 Sennott et. al. (2016) emphasize the importance of a naturalistic context and interaction.\u00a0 What it actually looks like will depend on a lot of factors, it is driven by what the AAC user needs, but should also incorporate the needs of communication partners.\u00a0 Fortunately, the literature gives us some bumpers in the road to guide us.\u00a0 Binger and Light (2007) propose a recommended \u201cdosage\u201d of 30 models in a 15-min session.\u00a0 Additionally, Drager et al. (2006) recommend that when using a symbol and pointing to a referent there should be no more than a 2-s delay.\u00a0 This may sound intense.\u00a0 You may be asking yourself, \u201cHow am I supposed to model 30 models in 15 minutes when I am participating in the activity, focused on keeping my client engaged, and trying to hold a clipboard and take data at the same time???\u201d\u00a0 We hear you, and so does every other clinician who has multi-tasked their way through a session with a complex learner.\u00a0 There are a variety of barriers to providing this ideal level of \u201cdosage,\u201d and the workaround to this is likely rooted in asking yourself what you can manage to model.\u00a0 We defer to Allen et al. who said: \u201cOverall, it is important for practicing clinicians to develop their own aided AAC modeling and ALM treatment protocols that meet the communicative needs of their cognitively and linguistically diverse clients.\u201d (Allen et al. 2017 p. 156) It\u2019s important to know that when using aided language modeling it might look different when you do it vs. when your colleague does it.\u00a0 What matters is whether or not the intervention is working.\u00a0 Allen et al. agree, and state: \u201cCareful data tracking and analysis of language outcomes will allow clinicians to manipulate their treatment protocols in response to or lack of response to intervention.\u201d (Allen et al. 2017 p. 156) So, what does it look like? You may have to decide that for yourself and your client.\u00a0 Rest assured it\u2019s OK if your style doesn\u2019t match your colleague\u2019s.\u00a0 Just be sure to match your rates of modeling with the linguistic and cognitive level of your client, be sure to do it in balance with other expectations in therapy, and take the data to back it up.\u00a0 What should I do next? Yeah, it\u2019s big and intimidating to do a good job with this, but if you break it down into the small parts and tackle everything bit by bit it\u2019s doable. Step 1: Plan it Consider your client\u2019s overall strengths and areas of need such as attention, receptive and expressive language, sensory needs, and access methods.\u00a0 Then, think about the tasks that are relevant targets for your client such as:\u00a0 reciprocating a greeting at circle time, saying \u201cthat\u2019s mine\u201d to a peer, or learning new words and word combinations.\u00a0 Making a connection between all of these components will help in developing more meaningful targets for modeling. Be sure you are choosing targets that are interesting, motivating, and something they will come in contact with frequently.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, consider the environment: what are the variables that could influence how you model? Consider noise level, distractibility, and anything else in the environment that is relevant to your learner.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget that there are other ways to communicate too!\u00a0 The use of signs, gestures, or facial expressions should be something you consider \u2013 particularly if the person is physically able to use the gesture and it is frequently used by others (e.g., waving \u201chi\u201d, shaking your head for \u201cno\u201d, etc.). Action Item: Write it down.\u00a0 Everything is more manageable on paper.\u00a0 Write and organize these variables so you can see your plan and consider each factor and how they influence each other.\u00a0 Consider your client, the targets, the environment, and note any concerns you have.\u00a0 Make a list of accommodations you can make to the environment that could make modeling language more successful.\u00a0 Make a list of potential unaided or concrete aided supports (objects) you may also want to incorporate in your modeling intervention.\u00a0 Write it down in a table or graphic organizer that is available to you.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t have one, use ours (see the example below; there is a blank version available for download here). Step 2: Try it out You don\u2019t know what will work until you give it a try.\u00a0 You\u2019ve planned it all out, thought through the important variables, and there\u2019s only one way to find out if it will be effective! Bring your graphic organizer and notes.\u00a0 Take some extra time to modify the environment so you feel comfortable and set up for success. Action Item: Use the information you generated during Clinical Action Step 1 and try those things with your client.\u00a0 Try them across multiple sessions. \u00a0If you see them in different places or different types of environments, give those types of models a try in each place/activity.\u00a0 Take data to a degree that you are able, both quantitative and qualitative (to learn more about quality data collection see our data collection episode).\u00a0 We recommend taking data that can correspond to the specific planning and modifications that you did before the session (consider taking data on your planning document, or give this one a try). Make note of other observations and variables that are relevant. Step 3: Review, Revise, Repeat Review your data \u2013 did different things \u201cwork\u201d better in different places? What physical arrangements worked or didn\u2019t work? What did you learn from the implementation of ALM overall? Let your experience and data, both qualitative and quantitative, guide your decision making for how to move forward. \u00a0Step 4: Share it, Review, Revise, Repeat! \u00a0Define what you want others to do in clear, accessible language.\u00a0 Consider creating handouts, tables, or infographics to distribute to communication partners or as general visual supports for your classroom/clinic/etc.\u00a0 Provide models, training or other supports as needed.\u00a0 Check in with communication partners and make it clear that their feedback is important too! Action Item: Gather information from communication partners. There may be barriers to getting input from others (scheduling conflicts, etc.), consider different ways that you could get the information you need such as having a personal conversation, using a checklist they can fill out (see an example here!), or a more formal data collection process.\u00a0 Start small, so communication partners and your clients feel successful and supported.\u00a0 Review all the components mentioned in Step 3, incorporating the input from others to modify as needed whenever there are challenges or whenever your client has achieved new skills and is ready for more! To learn more about aided modeling interventions, we encourage you to check out the references listed below.\u00a0 Overall, aided modeling intervention is a strategy that can benefit both the communicator and their partners.\u00a0 By modeling, communication partners are likely to become more familiar with vocabulary that is currently in, or may need to be added to, an aided AAC system.\u00a0 Partners may use slower rates of speech, and/or become more aware of target vocabulary, morphological, or syntactic structures.\u00a0 In summary, when you are planning your approach to modeling, think about factors connected with the who (the student/client), the what (their activity/task), and the where (environmental and communication partner features).\u00a0 There is no one, universal \u201cright way\u201d to provide aided input.\u00a0 Individualizing your approach may feel like a big task, but by breaking down the components into small parts, reflecting, and revising you will continue to refine what is successful for you as a clinician, your individual clients, and their unique communication partners.
