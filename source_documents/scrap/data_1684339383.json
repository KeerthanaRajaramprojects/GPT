{"url": "https://www.asha.org/about/governance/committee-and-board-chair-online-orientation/", "date": "", "text": " Why does ASHA have committees? Committees are an important part of the organizational structure [PDF] and the work force of associations. Associations are built on a system of committee actions linking the association with the attitudes and \u201creal world\u201d of its members. Committees are the bridge between members and leadership, between things to do and tasks completed, between what we can do and what we have accomplished. What are the benefits of committee work? Committees represent, involve, and serve members as well as provide a training ground for future leaders. Committees allow members with varied interests to be involved in the work of the Association. The work that is completed by ASHA committees helps grow and strengthen the Association, the professions, and the committee members themselves. Through committee service, ASHA members report that they grow personally and professionally; gain a sense of professional community; and enhance their collaboration, problem solving and communication skills. How does ASHA establish committees and boards? ASHA\u2019s Board of Directors (BOD) may establish a volunteer group to carry out some business of the Association. Definitions for the various volunteer groups that the BOD may establish (e.g., standing committees, boards, councils and ad hoc committees can be found in the Committee Toolkit [PDF]. Each committee, board and council reports to a BOD member who serves as a Board Liaison and is assigned a National Office staff liaison. Who appoints committee members? Members are appointed by the Committee on Committees (CoC). The CoC finds potential committee members from the Volunteer Pool of applications maintained by the National Office. Members become part of the pool by submitting a Committee Interest Form. Committee chairs may not appoint members on their own initiative. Chairs are asked to provide their Board Liaison with any recommendations they may have for new members. The Board Liaison will then make their recommendations to the CoC. Invitations are extended and appointments are made only following approval by the CoC. Additional information on the committee appointment process can be found on p. 5, 14 and 15 of the Committee Toolkit [PDF]. A timeline for the committee appointment process can be obtained from your staff liaison or ex officio. How is the scope of the committee\u2019s work defined?  The committee charge outlines the committee\u2019s scope of activities and cannot be changed. The committee chair is responsible for keeping the work of the committee focused on the charge and aligned with the strategic plan. See the Committee Toolkit [PDF] for more information on Committee and Board Operations. What is meant by \u201cfiduciary responsibilities\u201d? A quick check of the term \u201cfiduciary responsibilities\u201d on the Internet revealed three pages of definitions! But, a common thread running through all of the definitions is that fiduciaries \u201chave discretionary authority over another's money, property, or other assets, and a legal duty to act in a manner that benefits the other person, or organization.\u201d Of particular importance are the fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and fidelity to purpose. What is the duty of care?  The duty of care [PDF] focuses on the level of diligence exercised by a committee member in carrying out their duties. It states that a board [committee] member shall discharge their duties as a board [committee] member, (1) in good faith, (2) with the care an ordinary prudent person in like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and (3) in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the best interest of the Association. How can I satisfy the duty of care? You can help to satisfy the Duty of Care by promoting open debate, recording dissent, and creating a record of decision-making processes. What is the duty of loyalty? The duty of loyalty [PDF] states that committee members are obligated to act in the association\u2019s best interests and not to use their authority to advance personal interests, or the interests of related third parties. These self-interests could be financial, or related to enhancing prestige and professional reputation of oneself or one\u2019s employer. The phrases \u201cconflict of interest\u201d and \u201cself-dealing\u201d describe potential breaches of the Duty of Loyalty. How can I satisfy the duty of loyalty? You can satisfy the duty of loyalty by being aware of potential conflicts between one\u2019s personal interests and those of the Association; requiring committee members to disclose any possible conflict of interest; and asking committee members to refrain from participating in discussion and/or vote if a conflict of interest could influence their judgement. What is the duty of fidelity to purpose? The duty of fidelity to purpose [PDF] states that the Board of a nonprofit association must follow the association\u2019s purposes and goals as set out in the association\u2019s articles, bylaws, purpose, and mission statements. An association\u2019s articles of incorporation equal a legal contract between a state and the association. An association\u2019s bylaws equal a contract between the members and the association. This duty is particularly important when an association obtains public funding based on representations of its goals and purposes. How can I satisfy the duty of fidelity to purpose? You can comply with the duty of fidelity to purpose by reviewing the stated purpose of the association and examining whether proposed actions [i.e., committee charge] are consistent with the association\u2019s purposes. Who are the members of the committee team? The committee team consists of the Board Liaison, chair, committee member, and ex officio. What is the role of the board liaison? The Board Liaison directs the work of the committee via the Chair. The Board Liaison helps clarify the charge to the chair, and may request minutes, attend meetings, and react to work in progress. When appropriate, the Board Liaison posts summaries of committee activity to the Headlines e-mail list. What is the role of a chair? The chair serves as both the leader of the committee and as the skillful facilitator of discussion. The chair facilitates the work of the committee, provides oversight, and ensures that the goals and objectives of the committee are met. The chair fulfills this role by accepting and supporting the committee\u2019s charge, setting appropriate expectations around members\u2019 contributions and responsibilities, planning (with staff) and participating in all committee meetings, delegating and monitoring work assignments, maintaining records and relevant information on committee work, and moving members toward participation and decision making. What is the role of the committee member? Committee members are expected to be active by fully participating in committee meetings, completing assignments delegated by the chair, and working toward the fulfillment of the group\u2019s objectives. What is the role of the National Office ex officio member? The ex officio member serves as a full, participating member of the committee, although they do not vote. The ex officio serves as a resource on existing ASHA policies, products, procedures, and programmatic history and ensures coordination of work with the overall governance structure and other National Office units. See the Committee Toolkit [PDF] for more information on the roles and responsibilities of committee team members. Does the committee have a budget?  Yes. Activities of ASHA committees are budgeted under a separate category in the Association\u2019s annual budget referred to as the Officer-Committee-Board or O-C-B budget. Committees spend funds only for the level of activities that was approved. In addition, committees may not spend funds on activities for which the funds were not originally intended. Is funding available for committee meetings at the ASHA Convention? There is no reimbursement of travel expenses associated with the ASHA Convention for any ASHA members, including BOD members. This policy applies to day(s) before, during, and after convention travel and for attendance at ASHA committee meetings. What is the budget cycle for the OCB budget? Budgeting for O-C-B expenses begins in the early spring when the chair with the assistance of the Ex Officio submits budget estimates (OCB-1) for the next calendar year. During the summer, the Vice President for Finance reviews the budget estimate and revises if necessary. In the fall, the Board of Directors establishes and approves the O-C-B budget as part of the Association\u2019s overall budgeting process. In December, letters are mailed to each committee chair communicating the approved budget for their committee. How is travel for a face-to-face committee meeting approved? Eight weeks before the tentative meeting dates, the Ex Officio submits, on behalf of the chair, an Authorization to Travel form (OCB-2) to the Convention and Meetings staff. Only after receiving communication from Convention and Meetings staff are committee members authorized to make their travel arrangements. How does a committee member get reimbursed? To receive reimbursement for travel-related expenses, complete a travel and expense voucher, the travel reimbursement form and return it with all original receipts to the National Office staff liaison within 60 days. See the Committee Toolkit [PDF] for more information on managing committee budgets. Below are tips that will facilitate your success in leading, communicating, and facilitating the work of your committee. Good chairs lead productive and fun meetings! As a committee chair, the following techniques can help you bring out the best in your group. [1] Schlegel, J.F. (January, 2006). Let\u2019s Meet. Associations Now.  Retrieved July 24, 2008 from the American Society of Association Executives website http://www.asaecenter.org/publicationsResources/whitepaperdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=30454 In 2008, ASHA implemented \u201cASHA\u2019s Strategic Pathway to Excellence.\u201d As part of the Pathway, ASHA developed Vision, Mission, and Core Value statements, identified four \u201cPillars of Excellence\u201d that focus ASHA\u2019s strategy, and Strategic Objectives that indicate what ASHA must do to be successful in providing value for its members. For each of the Strategic Objectives, ASHA has identified Performance Measures and Targets that are used to track results in achieving the Strategic Objectives. Strategic Initiatives have been developed that are the priority projects that need to be implemented to ensure that the Strategic Objective outcome is achieved. To achieve ASHA\u2019s strategic outcomes, the work of all Association entities (e.g. committees, boards, councils, special interest groups, and National Office clusters and teams) will need to be aligned with ASHA\u2019s Strategic Pathway, and to the extent possible, support the completion of these objectives. All of the Association\u2019s work occurs at one of three levels described below: Run: Work at the run level ensures that we maintain and sustain function. The basic functions of the group in meeting its purpose, mission or charge occur at this level. This includes having the infrastructure, training, and expertise to perform those basic functions. As examples, work at the Run level for the Association includes things like having our annual Convention, processing Certification applications, providing technical assistance, projecting a budget, conducting continuing education programs, developing products to meet member needs, etc. A Committee, Board, or Council\u2019s routine and operational functions would occur at this level. Grow: Work at the grow level occurs to increase efficiencies, to stay at the cutting edge and employ best practices, or to enhance or streamline performance. ASHA\u2019s growth opportunities and quality improvement efforts exist at this level. Examples include conducting audits or optimization studies and implementing their recommendations, developing online applications for increased member access to information or resources, updating and revising our databases, offering our professional development programs on new or enhanced platforms, etc. At the grow level, a Committee, Board or Council might take on improving an existing product or process within its purview. Transform: Strategy lives at the transformational level; although it does occur across all three. This is where we look for opportunity to innovate, to overhaul and to create new systems. Work at this level dramatically changes services to members in response to dramatic changes in the world around us and allows us to engage and empower members to practice in a new and different way. An example of transformational work is the effort to build ASHA\u2019s Practice Portal. We're now able to provide members with quick and easy access to information and answers to their questions, instead of our former families of policy documents. ASHA hopes to mark its centennial in 2025, with the completion of outcomes identified in the current Strategic Pathway to Excellence, i.e., achievement of the Association\u2019s Strategic Objectives are intended to result in ASHA\u2019s revised Envisioned Future 2025. Committees, Boards, and Councils should consider the Association\u2019s strategic outcomes and how they might influence or impact completion of related objectives as they develop their workplans. ASHA\u2019s Strategic Pathway to Excellence: Strategic Objectives What is meant by \u201cmulticultural infusion\u201d? Multicultural infusion refers to ensuring that the unique combination of cultural variables\u2014including for example, ability, age, beliefs, ethnicity, experience, gender, gender identity, linguistic background, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, etc., that the professional and the client/patient/student bring to interactions are considered and addressed to the extent possible in the work done for the Association. Each and every individual has a culture, and thus, there are a number of dimensions that can impact each interaction and communication. ASHA has an expectation that members working on behalf of the Association will as appropriate, systematically address the influence of cultural and linguistic factors as a matter of routine in their operations. What role does multicultural infusion play in the work of my committee? Multicultural infusion ensures that the work of your committee serves multiple member or client populations, and extends the impact of your committee\u2019s scope and the breadth of your programs, products, or services so they benefit any relevant member or client populations. Why should multicultural issues be considered in the development or revision of Association programs and products? ASHA has a philosophical and practical commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Professional competence requires that audiologists and speech-language pathologists practice in a manner that considers each client's/patient's/caregiver's cultural and linguistic characteristics and unique values so that the most effective assessment and intervention services can be provided. Thus, any work done for the Association and the products developed should reflect applicable cultural variables in education and service delivery. Integration of multicultural issues throughout service provision, and program or product development ensures that individuals are not un-served or under-served by the Association or its members. Any practical tips on how I can get started?  Sure! Read below! See the ASHA Web site for more Multicultural Issues and Resources. What is a cardinal document? ASHA\u2019s cardinal documents are the Code of Ethics, the Scope of Practice in Audiology, Scope of Practice in Speech-Language Pathology, Speech Language Pathology Assistant Scope of Practice and position statements. These documents are written for and by ASHA members and approved by our governance to promulgate best practices and standards in the professions of audiology and speech-language pathology. How is a cardinal document approved?  Once a draft of the cardinal document has been developed, it undergoes professional editing and peer review, which is usually an online process. Following the peer review process, a resolution is prepared for submission to the Board of Directors requesting that the cardinal document be approved (See the Committee Toolkit [PDF]). What is the peer review process for cardinal documents?  Cardinal documents undergo both select peer review and widespread peer review. During select peer review, the document is sent to a targeted set of individuals with subject matter expertise. In widespread peer review, the availability of the draft document is announced to ASHA membership, which is invited to participate in the review and commenting process. These two peer review processes may be conducted concurrently or sequentially. What happens to a cardinal document once it is approved?  Once a cardinal document is approved, an ASHA editor and Web team staff member will format and post the final document on ASHA\u2019s website. The Board Liaison and ex officio can assist in creating a plan disseminating information about the new version of the cardinal document (e.g., submit an article for The ASHA Leader, give a committee presentation at the ASHA convention, conduct a continuing education ASHA program, present information about the document at a state conference). What is the timeframe for approval? ASHA\u2019s editorial staff should be notified two months prior to the anticipated peer review date. Please allow two weeks for editing. Depending on the size and number of documents being developed, the select and widespread peer review process can take anywhere from two to six weeks. When is it appropriate to submit a resolution?  Resolutions proposed must be compatible with the Association\u2019s purposes as stated in the Association\u2019s Bylaws and, as appropriate, any applicable Strategic Objectives/Strategic Initiatives in ASHA's Strategic Pathway to Excellence. The development of a resolution is appropriate only when the proposed actions are possible and practical within the Association\u2019s current structure or policy. Please review the document, Principles for the Preparation of Resolutions on ASHA\u2019s website for additional information. Who can submit a resolution for consideration by the Board of Directors?  Resolutions originate with an Association committee/board/council, special interest group, National Office staff or other ad hoc committees or working groups. Do resolutions undergo a review prior to being considered by the Board?  Yes. Resolutions are submitted to an internal review team comprised of representatives from editorial services, budget, information services, planning, and the appropriate chief staff officer. After adjustments resulting from the internal review process, the resolution is submitted to the BOD for consideration. Please refer to the Committee Toolkit [PDF] for additional information on the resolutions process. How often does the BOD review resolutions?  The Board reviews resolutions throughout the year so actions can be taken in a timely manner and typically acts on resolutions electronically. Refer to Resolutions Process on ASHA\u2019s website for detailed information for the consideration of a resolution once it is received by the Board. What is the timeline from development to consideration of a resolution? The timeframe is approximately two to three weeks. The internal review process takes approximately seven days. Once the resolution is submitted to the Board, they are given approximately five to seven days to discuss the resolution and then to vote on it. Where can I find the resolution form? Please consult your Ex Officio to obtain and draft a resolution form.
