{"url": "https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/medicare/aud_coding_rules/", "date": "", "text": " This page provides an overview of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae American Medical Association) coding policies for Medicare Part B (outpatient) audiology services, including a complete list of CPT codes and special coding rules. Although these coding guidelines are based on Medicare policies, keep in mind that other third party payers may adopt similar policies. CPT Assistant references are American Medical Association policies for coding best practice. Audiologists should also verify payment rules with their local Medicare Administrative Contractor and review ASHA's annual analysis of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for Medicare Part B policy changes and national payment rates. Please contact reimbursement@asha.org for questions related to audiology services. On this page: Most CPT/HCPCS codes reported by audiologists are untimed and do not include time designations in the code descriptor. An untimed code is billed once per day, regardless of the time spent providing the service. On the other hand, timed codes include a time designation in the descriptor (for example, \"per hour,\" \"first hour,\" \"initial 15 minutes,\" \"each additional 30 minutes\") and may be billed multiple times per day to represent the amount of time spent in direct patient care. Bill a timed code only when face-to-face time spent in an evaluation is at least 51% of the time designated in the code's descriptor. See also:  The Right Time for Billing Codes For CPT codes designated as 15 minutes, multiple coding represents minimum face-to-face treatment, as follows 1 unit: 8 minutes to 22 minutes 2 units: 23 minutes to 37 minutes 3 units: 38 minutes to 52 minutes 4 units: 53 minutes to 67 minutes 5 units: 68 minutes to 82 minutes 6 units: 83 minutes to 97 minutes, and so on and so forth. Clinicians use code modifiers appended to CPT or HCPCS codes on a claim to provide additional information about the services provided. For example, untimed codes may include modifiers to represent atypical procedures. Untimed CPT codes represent the \"typical\" time it takes to complete a specific evaluation or treatment. For significantly atypical procedures, a -22 modifier can be used to indicate that the work is substantially greater than typically required and a -52 modifier for an abbreviated procedure. Modifier -22 shouldn't be used frequently because the Medicare contractor could determine that the procedure reflects typical service delivery. Claims with the -22 modifier require an additional description of the need for extended services. Modifiers -22 and -52 may not be used in conjunction with timed codes. Modifier -59 is used to establish one procedure as distinct from another procedure billed on the same day, but should only be used based on instruction from the payer. Medicare publishes National Correct Coding Initiative (CC) edits that may require modifier -59. See Medicare's National Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) edits for restrictions on certain CPT code pairs reported on the same day. Unless specifically noted in the descriptor, audiology-related CPT codes represent bilateral testing. Include modifier -52 (reduced service) for unilateral testing. (Reference, CPT Assistant, June 2004, p. 10) Some audiology codes include a PC/TC split, meaning that payment for the code can be split based on who provided specific components of the service. The professional component (PC) reflects the portion of the procedure that involves the clincian's professional work (e.g., interpreting test results). The technical component (TC) reflects the portion of the procedure that doesn't include the clinician's participation (for example, a technician's participation). The global service is billed when both the PC and TC of a service are personally furnished by the same clinician. See ASHA's Medicare Fee Schedule for Audiology Services for a listing of codes with the PC/TC split and Medicare Billing of Audiology Services for additional details. The following table lists services and procedures covered under the audiology diagnostic benefit. 92517 Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing, with interpretation and report; cervical (cVEMP) New in 2021.

To report more irrigations than indicated in the code, consider using the modifier -22 to indicate an increased service. In those circumstances, audiologists should be prepared to provide justification for the increased service. 92538 Caloric vestibular test with recording, bilateral; monothermal (i.e., one irrigation in each ear for a total of two irrigations) (Do not report 92538 in conjunction with 92270, 92537) (For one irrigation, use modifier -52) (For bithermal caloric vestibular testing, use 92537) CPT code 92538 may not be billed more than once on the same date of service. To report more irrigations than indicated in the code, consider using the modifier -22 to indicate an increased service. In those circumstances, audiologists should be prepared to provide justification for the increased service. 92540 Basic vestibular evaluation, includes spontaneous nystagmus test with eccentric gaze fixation nystagmus, with recording, positional nystagmus test, minimum of 4 positions, with recording, optokinetic nystagmus test, bidirectional foveal and peripheral stimulation, with recording, and oscillating tracking test, with recording.

Do not report 92557 if you do not complete all required components (pure tone air and bone conduction, speech reception thresholds, and speech recognition testing). Instead, bill for the individual components of testing using 92552, 92553, 92555, and/or 92556. 92561 Bekesy; diagnostic Deleted in 2022. Report\u00a0 \u00a0(unlisted procedure) for Bekesy testing. 92562 Loudness balance test, alternate binaural or monaural 92563 Tone decay test 92564 Short increment sensitivity index (SISI) Deleted in 2022.

See also: Audiology CPT and HCPCS Code Changes for 2021 92651 describes nonautomated follow-up electrophysiologic testing to rule out significant hearing loss, including auditory neuropathy/auditory dyssynchrony, or to verify the need for additional threshold testing. Testing includes obtaining responses to broadband-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) using click stimuli at moderate-to-high and low stimulus levels. Don't report 92651 in conjunction with 92652 or 92653. 92652 Auditory evoked potentials; for threshold estimation at multiple frequencies, with interpretation and report New in 2021. See: Audiology CPT and HCPCS Code Changes for 2021 92652 describes extensive electrophysiologic estimation of behavioral hearing thresholds using broadband and/or frequency-specific stimuli at multiple levels and frequencies. 92652 can also include testing with high level stimuli and rarefaction/condensation runs to confirm auditory neuropathy/auditory dyssynchrony. 92652 reflects comprehensive AEP testing for the purpose of quantifying type and degree of hearing loss. Don't report 92652 in conjunction with 92651 or 92653. 92653 Auditory evoked potentials; neurodiagnostic, with interpretation and report New in 2021.

Report this code when the purpose of testing is to identify brainstem or auditory nerve function. 92653 is a less extensive test than 92652 and the basic elements of 92653 are already included in 92651 or 92652 when they are performed to identify and quantify hearing impairment. Don't report 92653 in conjunction with 92651 or 92652. 92700 Unlisted otorhinolaryngological service or procedure Report 92700 for a covered Medicare service that does not have a corresponding CPT code. See also: New Procedures...But No Codes Medicare doesn't recognize screenings, treatment, hearing aid, and electrophysiological services outside the hearing and balance systems when performed by an audiologist. The codes listed in this table may not be considered billable to Medicare by audiologists, although some may be performed by audiologists \"incident to\" a physician, when performed within the audiology scope of practice and in compliance with state laws and regulations. This means the audiologist's services are billed under the physicians NPI and the physician must be on premises when services are provided. Some services outside of the Medicare audiology benefit may also be billed directly to the Medicare beneficiary, such as hearing aid services.
