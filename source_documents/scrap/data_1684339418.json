{"url": "https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/coding/cci-edit-tables-slp/", "date": "", "text": " Updated for Quarter 3, 2021 The National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI, or more commonly, CCI) is an automated edit system to control specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) code pairs that can be reported by an individual provider on the same day for the same patient. This page provides Medicare Part B edits for code pairs commonly reported by speech-language pathologists (SLPs). For questions, please contact\u00a0reimbursement@asha.org.\u202f\u00a0 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) developed the edits for use on all Medicare Part B (outpatient) claims. They include CCI edits for provider-based services provided in clinics, private practices, and physician offices, and Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) edits for outpatient hospital and other facility-based services, including skilled nursing facilities, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and certain home health services.\u202fState Medicaid agencies are also required to use CCI edits, but may modify them to meet their own programmatic needs. Other third-party payers may also adopt CCI edits. Please check with non-Medicare payers regarding their use of CCI edits. SLPs should also be aware of Medically Unlikely Edit (MUE) restrictions, which are a subset of CCI edits that limit the number of times individual CPT codes may be billed on the same day, for the same patient. Please see \u202fASHA's\u202foverview of the NCCI system\u202ffor additional information and resources, including appropriate use of modifiers. SLPs should also review Chapter 1 of the official NCCI Policy Manual\u202ffor detailed guidance from CMS.\u202fChapter 11, Section H (Otorhinolaryngologic Services) of the manual provides additional\u202fguidance related to speech-language pathology services. Here are some key things SLPs need to know about CCI and OCE edits.\u00a0 CMS updates CCI and OCE quarterly.\u00a0 SLPs should check this resource regularly because CMS makes quarterly updates, beginning on January 1 of each year. ASHA reviews the changes and makes updates to the speech-language pathology table, as needed.\u00a0The July 2021 quarterly updates did not include changes to speech-language pathology related code pairs. Code pairs should apply to the provider, not the facility or office where services were provided.\u00a0 According to\u00a0CMS's NCCI FAQs, each code pair applies when reported by the\u00a0same provider/supplier,\u202ffor the same patient,\u202fon the same date of service. This may be complicated when billing under a clinic or facility's group number. Be sure the rendering provider's information is associated with each CPT code on the claim to avoid potential denials based on CCI or OCE edits.\u00a0 Not all codes have a CCI or OCE edit.\u00a0 Keep in mind that not all codes have a CCI or OCE edit. If you don't see a speech-language pathology related code pair listed here, it means they\u202faren't subject to CCI restrictions\u202fand can be billed on the same day without a modifier. However,\u00a0remember\u00a0that the NCCI system doesn't include all possible combinations of correct coding edits or types of unbundling that exist.\u00a0You\u00a0are obligated to code correctly even if edits don't exist to prevent use of an inappropriate code combination.\u00a0 SLPs can't pair most codes in the physical medicine series (e.g., 97129) with a speech-language pathology related code (e.g., 92507). Although not all code pairs are explicitly listed in the CCI edits, Chapter 11, Section H-2 of the Medicare NCCI Policy Manual\u00a0states that SLPs can't report \"CPT codes 97110, 97112, 97150, 97530, 97129 as unbundled services included in the services coded as 92507, 92508, or 92526\". In addition, Section H-3 notes that a single practitioner, such as an SLP, should not bill CPT codes 92507 or 92508 on the same date of service as 97129/97130 or 97533. For more information on the use of physical medicine codes see the Medicare Coding Rules for SLPs. For more on billing for cognitive therapy, see Coding and Payment for Cognitive Evaluation and Treatment Services. Learn when to appropriately use modifier -59 or its subcategory modifiers to bypass an edit.\u00a0 This resource lists only code pairs with a \u202fCCI edit\u00a0restriction\u202f\u00a0and\u00a0outlines whether the restriction can be bypassed with an NCCI-associated modifier. Although there are a number of NCCI-associated modifiers,\u00a0modifier -59 (distinct procedural service)\u202fis the only one used with speech-language pathology related edits. Some payers may require a more specific set of subcategory modifiers. Use these modifiers\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0(not in addition to) modifier -59.\u00a0 Use modifiers to bypass CCI edits sparingly and only when clinically justified. Don't append a modifier to a code pair solely to bypass a CCI edit if the clinical circumstances don't justify its use. In addition, don't use modifier -59 (or a subcategory modifier) if it isn't specifically required by the NCCI system, as this could cause denials. Please review CMS's resource on\u202fmodifier -59\u00a0[PDF] for additional guidance.\u00a0 ASHA derived the following speech-language pathology related CCI and OCE edits from the complete lists of edits published on the\u00a0CMS website. ASHA reviews CMS's quarterly updates and makes changes, as needed. Column 1\u00a0lists the payable code. Column 1 codes should always be listed first on the claim. Column 2\u00a0lists\u00a0the code that is not payable when paired with the Column 1 code, unless a modifier is permitted. If permitted, append the modifier to the Column 2 code when submitting the claim. Column 3\u00a0indicates whether a modifier is permitted to bypass the edit in both office and facility-based settings. Note:\u00a0Quarterly CCI edit changes are bolded in the table. There are no changes to this table for Q3.
