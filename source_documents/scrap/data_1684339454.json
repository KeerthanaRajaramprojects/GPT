Charlie is an OT and ATP who has been working with people with disabilities for over 20 years. In this post, he introduces us to Google Action Blocks and discusses some of the ways it can benefit those with AAC needs. A Look at Google Action Blocks When most of us consider the use of modern portable devices as communication aids we\u2019re likely to refer to iPads running popular apps such as LAMP Words for Life or Proloquo2go. It is relatively rare that people first consider Android AAC apps, most likely because there are so few of them. Android Worldwide, Android devices outsell Apple by a factor of 3 to 1. In South America and Asia this is as high as 10...

Core Vocabulary Activities: Check out these fun ideas from teachers and clinicians. Use Candy Heart Generators and Word Clouds Create your own digital candy hearts with your own text with\u00a0CryptoGram. Word clouds are a fun way to integrate a theme.

CALL Scotland\u2019s Claire Harrison has some wonderful ideas for us. Enjoy! \u00a0 Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: Apps, CALL Scotland February 14, 2018\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\t1 Comment We\u2019re making progress in teaching our little AAC learners. We know the pedagogy and evidence-based strategies. But we still have to figure out how to plan engaging instructional sessions with specific activities and materials. While we like to get kids moving and interacting with toys and other playthings, sometimes we also include play and interaction using educational and recreational apps. But which ones? In today\u2019s featured video, SLP Betsy Furler shares some of her favorites. This video was part of the 2017 AAC in the Cloud Conference and we are grateful to them for making it available. \u00a0 If you liked this and other videos from AAC in the Cloud, you may want to participate in the 2018 AAC in the Cloud Conference this June. Stay tuned for details! Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: AAC activities, activities, Apps, engagement May 18, 2017\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\t2 Comments When we think of AAC apps, expressive communication and voice output generally come to mind. But there are other kinds of AAC apps, too, including those that are used to create printable materials. Today, we hear from a clinician who uses this kind of AAC app\u00a0on a regular basis. Georgia Karavias is a speech language pathologist whose career has centered around working with school-aged children and adolescents who have physical disabilities and communication difficulties. Georgia is passionate about utilizing alternative access methods and inclusive technologies to enable independent communication using AAC systems. \u00a0She currently works at Scope\u2019s Communication and Inclusion Resource Centre (CIRC) as part of the communication access team in a community capacity building role. \u00a0In this post, she talks about how she uses AAC and visual supports created with an app developed at her workplace. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: I am a speech pathologist who has worked with children with complex...

Lauren does a terrific job of identifying AAC, AT, and related resources and goes the extra mile in sharing them with others. Today, we feature a graphic that she developed to alert us of AAC apps that are discounted in support of Autism Awareness and Acceptance Month in the US app store. The discounts may be available in other areas as well. The graphic is not interactive so if you wish to purchase an app, you\u2019ll need to visit the iTunes App Store and search for the app you\u2019re interested in or visit the company\u2019s website.

Access, though, is a bit of a low bar. What we REALLY want is for them to have the supports they need in order to learn and achieve. In this post, we feature a trio of videos to help us look further into apps that will do just that. Thanks to the Center on Technology and Disability, and\u00a0AT Specialists Diana Petschaue and Luis Perez for these wonderful webinars. http://www.ctdinstitute.org/library/2015-11-06/apps-across-curriculum-and-platforms-support-struggling-learners-series Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: Apps, curriculum, education November 4, 2015\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\tLeave your thoughts Our video for this week features Beth Poss, an SLP and AT consultant, with a wealth of experience. In this video, Beth reviews the many ways in which\u00a0mobile technology can be used to to support the development of early language and literacy with young children who have disabilities. Many thanks to the Center for Technology and Disability for making this available. \u00a0 Filed under: Video of the Week Tagged With: Apps, Beth Poss, Center on Technology and Disability, mobile device October 26, 2015\nby Carole Zangari - \n\t\t\t\t8 Comments \u201cWhat\u2019s the best AAC app?\u201d I\u2019m starting to think that every AAC SLP has been asked this question at least a dozen times. And with over 200 AAC apps for mobile devices to choose from, it\u2019s no wonder that families and professionals are looking for\u00a0guidance. So when USSAAC (the US Society for AAC) invited me to participate in their webinar series, I knew just which topic I wanted \u00a0to tackle. In today\u2019s post, you can see the archived version of that webinar, get the handout, and pose some questions using the \u2018Comments\u2019 feature at the bottom of the page. Before we get to that, though, I\u2019d like to encourage those of you with strong interests in AAC who live in the US to become members.

Last week, I\u00a0was fortunate to be able to sit alongside a wonderful group of SLPs, OTs, teachers, and graduate students and participate in two full days of learning from \u00a0Sean Sweeney, known to many of you as The Speech Techie.\u00a0Thanks to\u00a0the generous support of the University of Miami-Nova Southeastern University Centers for Autism and Related Disabilities\u00a0(UM-NSU CARD) and the Partnership for Effective Programs for Students with Autism (PEPSA),\u00a0funded by the Florida Department of Education, Bureau of Exceptional Education and Student Services, we were able to offer this workshop for free.
