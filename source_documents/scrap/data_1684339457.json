Some of the apps we use and recommend are made for general \u00a0as well as \u00a0special education while others are just everyday apps developed \u00a0to make life easier. \u00a0When we use the apps for communication and language there are some features that help many of our students. \u00a0Additionally, there are updates and other things that really help educators. \u00a0This is just a beginning list of app features we love (feel free to write with more). THANKYOU APP DEVELOPERS FOR: Listening to feedback-\u00a0we have emailed many app developers with \u2018feedback\u2019 and have always received responses and often that feedback is incorporated into updates to the app. Building \u00a0in choice making opportunities-\u00a0We love apps that require active participation on the part...

Searching for fresh ideas for AAC and language practice? Tellagami (\u201ctell-uh-gah-mee\u201d) is a free iOS app that allows you to create short animations, save them to your device, post to Facebook, and share them by email, SMS text, or Twitter. Best part about it, in this busy SLP\u2019s opinion? Super easy to learn and use! The animations are called \u2018Gami\u2019s\u2019 and are short and fun to make. The app has a good amount of flexibility and you are only limited by your imagination. Here are some ideas for putting it to use in your AAC work. 1. Choice making: The AAC learner can work collaboratively with a peer to create a Gami. In doing so, he/she can make selections of things like the gender of the character, hair, clothes, and the background. 2. Peer interactions: Many of our AAC...

These awesome music apps were \u00a0selected because they have great choice making and commenting opportunities. You can use no tech, low tech, or an extra high-tech device to make choices and comment while you play with the app. Core words work great for choice making and commenting. \u00a0Whenever I play or sing, my kids love to say \u201cstop that\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t do that pleeeeease\u201d. When they play, I love to use aided language input (ALI) to say \u201cgood\u201d, \u00a0\u201cmore\u201d, \u201cagain\u201d, \u201clove it\u201d .
