Today, we learn about the way one school district in Illinois created a core vocabulary initiative that has been up and running for almost a decade. Kelly Key,\u00a0the Assistive Technology (AT) Coordinator for Barrington School District 220 serves as our tour guide. Kelly is passionate about giving students a voice through core vocabulary and empowering others to support students.\u00a0 She has been in the field for over 22 years as a special education teacher, an administrator, and AT Coordinator.\u00a0 Kelly presents at local, state, and national conferences and colleges on various AT topics including core vocabulary and AAC implementation. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: How We Do It: Getting to the CORE of Communication (Part 1) Rolling Out a Core Vocabulary Initiative- How this District has been going strong for\u00a0a decade! The Importance of Using Core Vocabulary As we all know, individuals with complex communication needs must have access to core vocabulary words. \u00a0 In order to maximize our student\u2019s exposure to core vocabulary (both verbally and visually) and because we knew the importance of immersing our students lives with these words,\u00a0 we launched our district-wide core vocabulary initiative 10 years ago! Overview of Barrington 220\u2019s Universal Core Approach to Language and Literacy Over nine years ago our unit school district (ages 3-21) started our core vocabulary initiative.\u00a0 We now call it our Universal Core Approach to Language and Literacy.\u00a0 Our original intention with implementing the initiative was to increase the confidence and comfort level, for both staff and parents with supporting our students that use communication devices, After just six months of implementing the initiative we realized the approach was even more powerful than we expected!\u00a0 We have found this not only helps support our AAC users but many students that struggle with language and literacy. The following are the key components to our core approach\u2019s success: We use core vocabulary words based on research on language and literacy from toddlers through adults (i.e., PRC\u2019s 100 Frequently Used Core Words, Gail Vantatenhove\u2019s Hybrid list based off of Banajee\u2019s research, as well as DLM\u2019s First 40). We use Minspeak symbols as our anchor set of symbols when a symbol is needed to represent a core word.\u00a0We have two low tech core board options.\u00a0  We have the 28 board that is based on the PRC Springboard 32 and the 84 board that has been adapted from the LAMP Words for Life main page.\u00a0\u00a0We customize student\u2019s boards with personal fringe vocabulary.  We think in core when developing lessons and activities.\u00a0 Our motto is \u201cWhen in doubt core it out!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 These words and visuals are built into lessons and activities both in school and in our student\u2019s homes.\u00a0 And we think in core when engineering our visuals and supports.  \u00a0  When our students enter our district at age three (or move into the district), they are exposed to core vocabulary on day one.\u00a0 We model on the boards and devices as much as we can.\u00a0 We say we talk to the students visually and verbally.   We have a multi-media Power Words core curriculum created by our very own Deidre Dobbels,\u00a0 (M.S. CCC-SLP/L) for our Early Childhood students which targets 16 early developing core words. We are currently working on the curriculums for our Elementary, Middle, and High School students.\u00a0 See the reference below to find these resources on Teachers Pay Teachers.\u00a0   We make sure all staff know what the target words are by providing visuals for the staff and students.  \u00a0  We have a core vocabulary committee.\u00a0 This is a group of staff from across the district meet in person and virtually throughout the year.\u00a0 Our meetings always start with each person bringing a lesson or activity they have \u201ccored out\u201d to share.\u00a0 We then share the file via our Core Google site.\u00a0 During the meetings, we also brainstorm new ideas to help implement core.\u00a0 We also develop and provide professional development for staff, students and parents. We really value sharing resources in our district.\u00a0 We created a shared Google site where staff can add materials they have created or adapted that are \u201ccored out.\u201d\u00a0 This site also includes our interactive core boards, core images, our low tech boards, cored out visual supports, and more to download and use with students. The site is organized in folders, there is a folder for each of our core words. As the Assistive Technology Coordinator for the entire district, I provide as much exposure and training as I can for staff, students, parents, and siblings!\u00a0 I do this in the classrooms through lessons I provide to the class.  I also provide trainings for parents during the day and in the evening to include our yearly \u201cAAC Family Fun Night\u201d.\u00a0 This event has been a huge success each year.\u00a0 The families come with their child that uses AAC.\u00a0 We start the evening with tips for implementation at home and then have stations for families to go to practice using the devices and get comfortable with the language.\u00a0 The families then get to take the materials and games home to use.\u00a0 I also provide training to all new staff during new educator orientation each Fall.\u00a0 I have also had principals get rotating subs to cover school day trainings.\u00a0 Summer trainings and before and after school trainings have also been a huge success.\u00a0 I have been very fortunate that many of our principals have allowed me to run a series of professional development during their staff meetings as well (to special education and general education staff)! When our students need something more high tech or more individualized, we hold a SETT meeting (We follow Joy Zabala\u2019s SETT process where we talk about the Student (likes, motivators, access/ motor needs, vision, behaviors, etc), Environment (since communication impacts all environments, we talk about what supports have been used in the past and current supports and pros and cons of each), Tasks (we share what do you want the student to be able to communicate that they are not able to communicate.\u00a0 We also brainstorm specific vocabulary and phrases and intentions), Tools (for tools, we feature match, we talk about what features we would like to see on an AAC system for the student).\u00a0\u00a0 This is a meeting with the team and parents, and at times the student as well!\u00a0 This is a terrific opportunity to brainstorm ideas from the start as a group and make the decision of which tool to try first together.\u00a0 This helps tremendously with device buy-in (see photo 10 of our form). Stay tuned for future posts in this series for more than 10 different ways that we have incorporated core vocabulary into our student\u2019s lives and communication systems. Since the implementation of our core initiative we have seen; Tips for Rolling out Your Own Initiative: Keep a lookout for our next Blog Post where Deidre Dobbels and I share our top ways we have personalized core-based communication for individual students. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: References/Credits Examples show materials created by Deidre Dobbles (SLP), Jennifer Simonaitis (SLP), Katie Johnson (teacher), Alyssia Van Duch (teacher), and Kelly Key.\u00a0 Feel free to contact me!\u00a0 Kkey@barrington220.org \u00a0 Filed under: Featured Posts, PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: core vocabulary, How I Do It, schools This post was written by Carole Zangari School Year of Core Vocabulary Words: AAC Resources for Month 10 (May) by Michaela Sullivan, Alisa Lego, & Beth Lytle PrAACtically April \u2013 More AAC Resources for A Year of Core Words School Year of Core Vocabulary Words: AAC Resources for Month 9 (April) by Michaela Sullivan, Alisa Lego, & Beth Lytle TELL ME About It: AAC Learning with \u2018The Skin You Live In\u2019!
