The easiest and fastest way to complete and check on the status of a funding application is at https://portal.aacfunding.com/login  The length of time depends on the paying source. As a general rule, upon receipt of a COMPLETE application it takes us approximately 30 to 60 days to review, submit, and receive a ruling from insurance. You may submit to your insurance company directly for a medical review; however, we recommend that you send the request to PRC-Saltillo Funding. When insurance companies review a funding application, they not only are reviewing it for medical necessity, but also look for procedure codes, ICD-9 codes, pricing and other pertinent information. PRC-Saltillo Funding is well trained on these guidelines and can provide your insurance company with proper documentation. One option is to call your insurance carrier and ask them if your policy has benefits to cover speech-generating devices. Or, if you have an insurance manual, review the sections pertaining to durable medical equipment, speech-generating devices, augmentative communication devices or even speech prosthesis. https://aacfunding.com/insurance-tips Please keep in mind that any benefit quoted by the insurance representative is not a guarantee of payment. It\u2019s important to inform your insurance company that PRC-Saltillo is the sole provider and manufacturer of all equipment bearing the PRC-Saltillo label. Many insurance companies make exceptions to your policy due to this fact and treat us as an in-network provider. If your insurance company will not allow this exception, we recommend appealing their decision. By signing the Assignment of Benefit (AOB) form for each insurance policy held by the client, the policyholder is giving their permission for the paying source to pay PRC-Saltillo Funding directly instead of paying the client. If the equipment is prepaid by a private source, an AOB will not be necessary. It is possible depending on the paying source. If this is an insurance policy or Medicare claim, the answer is yes. However, it is highly recommended that a pre-determination through your insurance company be completed and your benefits verified before you institute the purchase of PRC or Saltillo equipment. It is also critical that all the documentation meet Medicare's requirements before they will pay. In this case, we highly recommend that you send our Funding Specialist the Medicare documentation to review. Medicaid is payer of last resort. If payment is collected for services prior to Medicaid, there will be no reimbursement due to Medicaid's guidelines. PRC-Saltillo is extending credit by shipping the device before we receive payment. A Social Security number is required for such an extension of credit. At a minimum, PRC-Saltillo Funding requires 60 days to process the order but cannot make any guarantees that it will be processed in time due to factors outside our control. Your SLP will work with the AAC Funding specialist to file an appeal.
