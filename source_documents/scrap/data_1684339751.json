In her previous post, Deanna talked about her work with AAC groups for adults. Today, she shares a lesson plan and some implementation ideas. As a veteran AAC interventionist, Deanna\u2019s therapy plan has many wonderful features that undoubtedly contribute to the success her students experience.\n Lesson/therapy Session: \u00a0Using Social Phrases/Comments Intended audience & type of AAC: \u00a0All devices/AAC users should have access to social commenting. Our Class: Middle school, self-contained classroom. Group of 3 students, SLP leading activity, paraprofessional, and Teacher of Visually Impaired supporting Goal for Overall Lesson: Use word/icon combinations to express opinions or make social comments Specific Student Goals: \nMaterials: Websites with sound effects were used to elicit responses\n \nBackground Knowledge: \u00a0We have been practicing rating stories after we read them on www.TarheelReader.com. \u00a0This website provides prompts at the end of each story to rate with stars. \u00a0Now we will have an opportunity to make similar ratings with additional comments following a listening activity. Activity: \u00a0The three device users are positioned in front of the SmartBoard, with two teachers between them. \u00a0The SLP uses a laptop connected to the SmartBoard to launch the Haunted Castle activity previously downloaded. The haunted castle is displayed and we talk about how some people like to hear scary sounds and some people don\u2019t. \u00a0After the first scary sound, the activity is paused and the teachers model their opinions using the student communication devices first. \u00a0After that, teachers primarily act as facilitators/communication assistants, helping a little with navigation and quiet prompting using an agreed-upon chain of cues. \u00a0We continue playing the sounds in the Haunted Castle, not worrying about which rooms we enter or what images we see, but focusing primarily on the eerie sounds. \u00a0We then continue onto another website with sound effects, again looking for comments from the students. \u00a0As students comment, the group leader (SLP) reflects out loud on their opinions. \u00a0Number of words used by students were automatically recorded on the Dynavox devices using usage counts and on the PRC device using the Language Activity Monitor (data logging). \u00a0At the end of the session students and teachers were reminded that they can give opinions during many different activities, including reading/writing responses. Impressions: \u00a0We had a lot of fun with this activity. \u00a0One of the teachers consistently shared (first on an AAC device and later using her speech and body language) that she did not like scary sounds. \u00a0One of the students in particular (Student #3) laughed at the teacher and kept repeating on her device that the sounds were \u201cawesome\u201d and affirming, \u201cI like that.\u201d \u00a0She is the youngest in the group and tends to wear frilly dresses and pretty pink outfits. \u00a0We actually were concerned that she might be afraid. \u00a0It was very eye-opening to watch her attention riveted on the haunted castle scene and her delighted responses to the sounds. \u00a0The other two students basically complied with the activity, but didn\u2019t respond as much as Student #3. For more information/ideas about active listening and commenting, take a look at these Tips from Caroline Musselwhite\u2019s AAC intervention website: Filed under: PrAACtical Thinking Tagged With: AACtual therapy, commenting, Deanna Wagner, lesson plan, middle school, social phrases This post was written by Carole Zangari PrAACtically Visual: More Supports for Your Toolbox PrAACtical Resources: A Potpourri of Visual Supports, AAC Handouts, & More AAC Posts from PrAACtical Week # 21 \u2013 May 2019 Thoughts on Embracing Multilingualism and Diversity in AAC Love this activity, Deanna!
