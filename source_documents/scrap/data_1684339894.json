In this post, Amanda shares her views and experiences on helping students with AAC needs build their language skills. You can see her previous posts in this series here. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: How I Do It: AAC Therapy is Language Therapy I\u2019ve traveled between several states and many different schools over the past few years. Because of this, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working with some amazing SLPs! They\u2019re talented, strong, creative, and love their kiddos more than anything. And just like any other team, each of us has different strengths and weaknesses. When I\u2019m joining a Speech team, there\u2019s usually at least one other SLP with specialties that are outside of my wheelhouse. However, she isn\u2019t very comfortable with AAC. It sounds similar from place to place: Responses like that are okay because the SLP field is so large! We can be an expert in every single niche. Personally, AAC is my jam, but please don\u2019t ask me to do anything with feeding and swallowing. If you\u2019re feeling this way about AAC, you\u2019re in the right place! Let\u2019s see how to incorporate AAC into therapy sessions. Remember AAC is ultimately an access method for language At the end of the day, AAC is meant to increase receptive and expressive language. This means that we can use strong language lessons with our users of AAC with minimal to no modifications. Although the lesson plan may require some modifications based on the individual\u2019s needs and interests, the lesson shouldn\u2019t be completely altered simply because \u201cAAC\u201d is in the picture. Designing the Environment Visual supports are fabulous, wonderful, an almost-magical tool that can allow us to fade direct verbal and visual prompting for users of AAC across environments, including the therapy room, classroom, and around the home. These visuals can take many forms and provide a variety of services. They can aid in executive functioning skills like planning and following routines (see visual schedule above). They can also include symbols to prompt expressive language (using verbal language or AAC). Visuals can even be used as pacers to mark MLU or rate of speech. Keep in mind that, especially in the younger grades, any visual supports placed in the student\u2019s environment will not only benefit your specific student, but also the others in that environment. For example, I created a visual schedule (see above) for my students with devices to remind them to unpack their AAC device when they arrive at school. However, this visual can also help another student who is easily distracted and can\u2019t remember what to do once he gets to the cubbies. UDL at it\u2019s finest! AAC in small group language therapy Users of AAC can participate in small group therapy with the correct structures and supports. While they may require additional personnel and/or accommodations, users of AAC can and should participate with their peers while learning. Just like any other small group, instruction should be based on the students\u2019 goals and objectives. This can be done with the same story and activity! For example, if one student is working on pronouns and another is targeting the use of core vocabulary, both can work on pronouns together! Use the same book, videos, games, and toys to teach pronouns for each student, while addressing necessary modifications for accessibility as necessary. Expanding Utterances One of the hallmarks of language therapy involves targeting expansion of utterances, particularly beyond the one-word level. This is also a hallmark of therapy involving users of AAC! When working on this goal with AAC, it\u2019s important to remember to model both verbally and on the student\u2019s device (rather than using verbal language only). Remember to model for a variety of communicative functions (requesting, protesting, asking questions, sharing information, making comments, etc.), just as you would when working with a verbal student. Make it FUN! A few weeks ago, I talked about making sure to keep things fun while working with AAC! This is so important for so many reasons. Communication is significantly more challenging for users of AAC when compared to their typically developing peers. Also, these students are frequently tested rather than conversed with (i.e., \u201cWhat day is it today, Bobby?\u201d vs. \u201cHow are you today, Bobby?\u201d). If interactions with others involving AAC devices aren\u2019t enjoyable, meaningful, powerful, or fun\u2026 why would the student be motivated to use it?? When daily interactions and therapy sessions involving AAC devices are missing these key components, device abandonment is on the horizon. It is imperative that language lessons are fun AND functional! Lower Elementary For lower elementary students, I love using a combination of books, videos, songs, fine motor, and gross motor activities. I typically stick with a theme for a week or two weeks, depending on what the schedule looks like and what the classroom is doing. Especially in PreK, many classrooms have a theme that is woven into lessons and play throughout the week. Try connecting with a teacher to tie your lesson plans to these weekly themes! It provides students with previous knowledge of curriculum, promotes generalization, and makes push-in therapy much easier! Below are some lesson ideas that I\u2019ve done alongside the classroom\u2019s \u201cSpring\u201d theme:    Upper Elementary In upper elementary, it\u2019s still really important to play! I had several games in my room that were absolute staples: These can be used with almost any language group and somehow manage to incorporate a variety of language objectives. Have someone working on articulation and another practicing turn-taking? Tape articulation cards to the water bottles and take turns bowling! Middle School Middle school can be a tricky place because students are beginning to despise things, and it\u2019s hard to make things \u201cfun\u201d and \u201cappealing\u201d rather than \u201c\u2026 whatever.\u201d One thing that\u2019s always fun: messy science experiments!  During these experiments, make predictions, talk about outcomes, compare results, and make social comments! This is supposed to be fun! Check out this page for other science experiments for middle schoolers! High School Ah\u2026high school. Now everything is \u201c\u2026whatever\u201d! Don\u2019t take it personally \u2013 it\u2019s developmental. My high school class recently started implementing VR \u2013 virtual reality \u2013 into daily social studies lessons. You can use Google Earth VR to immerse your students in a completely different part of the world! Use this opportunity to: Also, if the Google Earth VR is pulled up on a tablet or in the Google Cardboard, it can be an interesting sensory experience! Vocational At my school, we have several vocational classes for students who qualify. Within these classes, student practice a variety of important job-oriented tasks, including counting and exchanging money, using social language with familiar people and strangers, following multi-step directions, tasks initiation and competition, and many more. One of the classes involves cooking, which is an important life skill! This involves many topics for language therapy sessions, including: Reach out to family members and teachers SLPs are communication specialists, but sometimes we lose sight of the importance of communication! I know that I can. Thankfully, in schools, we have IEP meetings, progress reports, and open house events to help connect families and therapists.\u00a0 In the private setting, we typically have time at the end of every session to briefly chat with family members.\u00a0 This is a great time to ask about parental concerns so that they can be addressed and incorporated into therapeutic goals as appropriate (i.e., within the student\u2019s zone of proximal development and as best meets the needs of the child). Student expectations After working with a student for several sessions, therapists have a good sense of what a child is able to do independently, where the child requires some prompting, and where the child is fully dependent on adults. The child\u2019s \u201cPlan of Care\u201d or IEP should delineate this information as well. It\u2019s important to continue relaying this information to caretakers, family members, and school staff as the student progresses. For example: \u201cJohnny can accurately and independently use his device to request a drink of water, so please provide him the necessary wait time and opportunities to do so throughout the school day and with a variety of people. However, Johnny\u2019s not yet bringing his device with him everywhere, so please scaffold this task by providing wait time, showing him a gestural cue towards other student\u2019s talkers, and using the provided visual cue.\u201d Bringing it all together Overall, it\u2019s important to remember that AAC therapy is language therapy. It can be done effectively utilizing engaging and meaningful activities. It\u2019s imperative to communicate expectations and progress with family members and school staff on a regular basis.
