My 2022 started on December 16th last year when I was appointed to the National Disability Insurance Agency board. I had been nominated when I was in hospital in June. Luckily these things take time, vetting and getting all State and Territory ministers to approve the nomination. The appointment started January 1st and it has not stopped. I have travelled to Sydney, Perth and Brisbane but thankfully most meetings are online or in Melbourne. There have been two meetings in Geelong but they were a joy as I stayed with Linley and Barry. Mum had another birthday party this year in a local restaurant again. We encouraged it because it was family and we all get to see each other. My cousin\u2019s husband (Peter) asked me sarcastically \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you now?\u201d I answered \u201cshingles\u201d and burst out laughing! I had shingles but luckily I was not as bad as I remember when Glenn had them at 18!!!! I will definitely have the shingles vaccine in five months time. Other than that my health has improved. I have put on five more kilograms and go to physio every fortnight. I am eating breakfast (cereal) and lunch (usually soup) orally and have my PEG feed at night. I am making the PEG work for me instead of the other way around. Saves cooking dinner and the time it takes planning it. I can eat more things than this time last year. I have graduated to eating some sweet biscuits which is helping with the weight gain. In October I made the front cover of Crosslight, Uniting Church Vic/Tas magazine. The lead article was on Spirituality and Disability and a book I helped launch (I did not contribute to the book though). In November I was at Government House with Mum and two friends for the Victorian nomination of the 2023 Australian of the Year award. No, I did not win the nomination and was relieved not to win the Victorian nomination. I am planning on going to Cancun, Mexico, in July for the ISAAC conference (deferred twice). My niece, Adara, has volunteered to go with me \u2013 that has made me more confident in travelling. We are thinking about what else to see while in the USA. Adara was with me in New York last time- I cannot beat that! After re-reading last year\u2019s Christmas letter I realise how far I have come in the past 12 months and even though I am a year older, life is good and God is looking after me. I hope next year\u2019s letter is less about me and more interesting\u2026 Have a blessed Christmas with those you love.

There\u2019s nothing like the energy and joy we feel when we get together in person, and the connections we make that move AAC forward. We\u2019re very excited for Conference Cancun in 2023 and Conference Roma in 2024. We\u2019re also in the middle of building a new website, which is a big project!\u201d\u00a0 I\u2019d like to welcome new board member and President-Elect, Yonit Hagoel-Karnieli from Israel. I also offer my deepest thanks and appreciation to all of ISAAC\u2019s past presidents who have helped to move the organization forward over the years. As President-Elect, I worked closely with outgoing President Juan Bornman who was a pillar of strength and kindness for ISAAC over the last two very difficult years. Juan held us up and worked alongside all of us as we accomplished some hard things, such as the ISAAC Connect virtual conference last year. We always felt appreciated by Juan as she shared her positivity and inspirational South African proverbs. She will have a lasting impact on the Executive Board and on ISAAC. So thank you Juan!\u201d \u2013 Tracy Shepherd See the full Executive Board here. \u00a0 \u00a0  Read the article on the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital website. \u00a0 ISAAC has developed a Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) for the purpose of assisting the organization to identify and select an appropriate Conference Management Company / Professional Conference Organizer (\u201cPCO\u201d).

He used his voice for advocacy for others, locally and nationally, for example in the testimony he provided to the Senate Committee on Aging\u00a0 Making A Difference For Others \u2013 AAC & Speech Devices from PRC (prentrom.com).\u201d\u00a0 \u2013 Amy Goldman, President, USSAAC \u201cRick Creech was a man of resilience and many accomplishments: author, poet, teacher, advocate, husband, father, son.
