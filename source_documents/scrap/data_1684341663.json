It was established in 1991 as a national chapter of the International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC). Our community includes people who can benefit from AAC, family members, professionals from multiple disciplines, students, and AAC-related companies and institutions. Today, AAC strategies, tools and technologies enable more than 2 million children and adults in the United States to gain access to their human and civil right to communicate. AAC gives people with complex communication the means to exercise choice and control and to be active participants in their own families and communities. USSAAC believes everybody has the right to communication and advocates for access to communication in all environments for people who use or need AAC. USSAAC supports a vision of a world in which: All forms of communication are respected. People with complex communication needs can communicate effectively using a variety of AAC methods. People who use AAC are recognized as leaders in their communities. Families can voice their concerns, challenges, hopes and dreams and be heard. Stakeholders in the AAC community can access relevant information about AAC and have lifelong learning opportunities. USSAAC members influence public policy and clinical practice. To that end, USSAAC has worked closely with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and other stakeholders to provide and protect Medicare funding for speech-generating devices (SGDs), organized and informed members of proposed challenges to CMS\u2019s SGD funding and potential impact on people who need and use AAC, monitored and, as necessary, intervened with state Medicaid programs and private insurers to support policies and practices regarding access to and reimbursement for SGDs and clinical services.
