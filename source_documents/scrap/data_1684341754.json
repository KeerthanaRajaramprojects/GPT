Prevalence of hearing loss increases with age. Men are about twice as likely as women to have hearing loss. Hearing loss is defined as when the average threshold across four speech frequencies (0.5\u20131\u20132\u20134 kHz) is greater than 25 decibels hearing level. The statistics above are for hearing loss that may occur in one or both ears. Source: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011\u20132012.
