The research recommendations should be aimed at technologies or delivery strategies that are effective, accessible, and affordable to those who want and need them; take advantage of current and evolving technologies and health care delivery models; consider innovative and creative solutions with potential for implementation; and reflect current demographics and varying socioeconomic capacities of the U.S. population. The focus is not on research related to the development of increasingly sophisticated or technologically complex custom-fit hearing aids. Research should complement and supplement, not replace, current paradigms and services. \u00a0", "authors": [], "external_links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html",
