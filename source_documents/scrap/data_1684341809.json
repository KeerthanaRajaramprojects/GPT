Tucci,\nM.D., M.S., M.B.A. February 28, 2023 The NIH Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) programs\u2014managed together at NIH under an umbrella program known as SEED (Small business Education and Entrepreneurial Development)\u2014empower small businesses and academic innovators to develop and bring to market new technologies that improve health. In this director\u2019s message, I describe these vital NIH programs and NIDCD\u2019s efforts to support research leading to commercialization of novel products and to advances in pharmaceuticals and devices in our mission areas. I also summarize topics discussed at the February National Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NDCD) Advisory Council Meeting. The SBIR and STTR programs are key parts of NIH\u2019s mission to turn discovery into health. NIH SEED\u2019s mission is to speed the conversion of scientific discoveries into healthcare solutions. SEED aims to spur technological innovation; fulfill federal research and development (R&D) needs; support private sector commercialization of innovations developed through federal R&D funding; and encourage entrepreneurship by underrepresented groups. To accomplish these goals, NIH SEED earmarks more than $1.2 billion annually through the SBIR and STTR programs to support early-stage small business research, including developing innovative products and devices and attracting partners and investors to take an innovation to market. Small businesses use SBIR/STTR funds in several ways to successfully bring technologies and innovations from bench to market. Some investigators only apply for Phase I R&D funding, while others seek several Phase II awards for additional research and development of multiple products. (The SEED website outlines various funding paths.) Academic innovators may also partner with small businesses to commercialize innovations developed in the lab, thereby making the innovations both profitable and widely available. Successful SBIR/STTR applicants come from a variety of fields and educational backgrounds (a Ph.D. is not a requirement). To expand participation, NIH provides application guidelines and diversity supplement funding to encourage applications from underrepresented groups, such as economically disadvantaged or women-owned small businesses. NIH also has several programs to assist academic investigators and help innovators commercialize their products and present them to investors. These programs are especially helpful for first-time applicants. NIDCD is an active participant in these efforts. We allocated more than $16 million in fiscal year 2022 to successful SBIR/STTR grants. Topics covered by this funding are broad and exciting. This year alone, some examples include a proposed mobile hearing test system to expand teleaudiology in underserved communities; wirelessly rechargeable cochlear implant batteries; and digital technology for measuring speech in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We prioritize applications that offer clear plans to commercialize a novel technology and make it widely available to address pressing needs in our mission areas: hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. I encourage academic innovators and small businesses to explore SBIR and STTR funding opportunities on the NIH site and to visit the frequently asked questions page for more information. We explain aspects of NIDCD\u2019s SEED participation on the SBIR/STTR page of our website. If you would like additional guidance on NIDCD\u2019s support of these innovative programs, contact our SBIR/STTR program director, Roger L. Miller, Ph.D. On February 2-3, the institute\u2019s advisory council convened virtually. Portions of our council meetings are open to the public, and I invite you to watch the archived videocasts of the February 2 and February 3 open sessions. I also encourage you to join us online for our next meeting, to be held May 18-19, 2023. A few highlights from February\u2019s meeting are summarized below.", "authors": [], "external_links": ["https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/hearing-aids",
