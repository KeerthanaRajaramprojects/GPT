The Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) is a medical and research database resource that supports qualified researchers studying pediatric hearing health. The database draws information from several sources, including electronic health records, audiological instruments, radiological imagery, clinical genetics results, and genomics research records, and makes them accessible to researchers using a powerful, intuitive, web-based query interface. By establishing AudGenDB, researchers and clinicians can more effectively address how underlying genetic and environmental factors influence the effectiveness and outcome of patient-directed therapies and interventions. Relevance: The aim is to facilitate effective identification of pediatric patients at high risk for congenital or late onset hearing loss, based on direct assessment of the audiologic and otologic features of children with all forms of hearing loss, and characterization of the genetic basis for hearing loss. The goal is to promote research into the causes of pediatric hearing loss with the long-term aim of developing therapies to ameliorate or cure congenital deafness. Sample size: N~175,000 children (2018). Access: Sponsoring or supporting organization: NIDCD The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) program is sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It includes three cohorts: a birth cohort and two kindergarten cohorts (the kindergarten classes of 1998\u20131999 and 2010\u20132011). The birth cohort study (ECLS-B) followed a sample of children born in 2001 from birth through kindergarten; the first kindergarten study (ECLS-K) followed kindergarteners in the 1998\u20131999 school year through the eighth grade; the second kindergarten study (ECLS-K:2011) followed kindergartners in the 2010\u20132011 school year through the fifth grade. The ECLS provides information about the preparation of children for school and how children develop in relation to their family, early childhood, and school environments. Relevance: Parents were asked about their children\u2019s hearing and recent experiences, including earaches, diagnosed ear infections (otitis media), recent colds, and exposure to loud sounds or noise. In an embedded subsample (n=3,000+), children\u2019s ears were visually examined to check for blockages. Then, audiometric thresholds were determined for each ear. Tympanometry was used to assess middle ear functioning in the embedded subsample. Sample size: Access:  Users can download data, documentation, and set-up files for SAS, SPSS, and STATA from the NCES website. Sponsoring or supporting organizations: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative cohort of adolescents recruited in grades 7 through 12 in the United States during the 1994\u20131995 school year. The Add Health cohort has been followed into young adulthood with in-home interviews conducted in Waves I to V (I: 1994\u20131995; II: 1996; III: 2001\u20132002; IV: 2008\u20132009; and V: 2016\u20132018). In Wave V, participants were aged 32 to 42 and a mixed-mode protocol was used that included web-based surveys. Add Health combines longitudinal survey data on respondents' social, economic, psychological, and physical well-being with contextual data on the family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement in young adulthood. A future Wave VI is planned with primary sponsorship from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), since subjects in this longitudinal cohort study will soon be over 40 years of age. Waves I and II focused on factors that may influence adolescents\u2019 health and risk behaviors. Wave III focused on experiences and behaviors related to decisions, behavior, and health in the transition to adulthood. Wave IV studied developmental and health trajectories from adolescence into adulthood, integrating social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences into its research objectives, design, data collection, and analysis. Wave V collected social, environmental, behavioral, and biological data to track the emergence of chronic diseases. Relevance: Hearing-related questions were asked at Waves III, IV, and V (e.g., \u201cHave you ever worn a hearing aid?\u201d and \u201cIf you wear a hearing aid, describe your hearing without it\u201d). Also, questions about tinnitus, balance, falls, voice, plus speech-language services during elementary school have been included in one or more waves. Sample size:  Access: Sponsoring or supporting organizations: The American Community Survey (ACS)\u00a0helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation. Originally, the content of the ACS was included as the \u201clong form\u201d in the decennial census. The ACS launched in 2005, replacing the once-a-decade census long form. The ACS design features ongoing monthly data collection aggregated on a yearly basis to enable annual data releases. By combining multiple years (typically, 5 years), the Census Bureau is able to release \u201cperiod\u201d estimates to produce reliable estimates for smaller areas such as counties or census tracts. Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their homes, and other topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this information to assess the past and plan the future. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year. Relevance: In 2008, ACS implemented six questions for reporting disability. These questions have been included in the National Health Interview Survey as part of the Family Disability Questions File since 2009. The hearing disability question is asked about each person in the household: \u201cIs this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d Five other disability questions are included that ask about: (1) vision \u2013 blind or has serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses; (2) because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions; (3) mobility \u2013 serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; (4) difficulty dressing or bathing; and (5) because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor\u2019s office or shopping. Sample size: Approximately 3.54 million households (2019). Access: Hearing disability data are available from 2008 to 2019. All publicly released data are available to download at the following webpages: Sponsoring or supporting organization: United States Census Bureau The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation\u2019s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. It was established in 1984 with 15 states. BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world. Relevance: From 2013 to 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) BRFSS collected data using five of the six disability questions; the question to identify a hearing disability (i.e., deaf or serious difficulty hearing) was not included. However, beginning in 2016, BRFSS included all six disability questions as part of the core component to assess disability status across the nation. The hearing disability question stated, \u201cAre you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?\u201d Sample size: N=418,268 (2019).

Sponsoring or supporting organizations: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an annual, cross-sectional survey providing nationally representative estimates on a wide range of health status and utilization measures among the civilian (non-military), non-institutionalized population of the United States. Each annual data set can be used to examine the disease burden and access to care that individuals and families are currently experiencing in the United States. NHIS is a principal source of national data used to track progress in meeting each decade\u2019s U.S. Healthy People goals. Relevance: NHIS includes supplemental questionnaires and periodic modules on topics of current interest. For example, adult hearing supplements were included in 2002, 2007, and 2014; adult dizziness and balance supplements were included in 2008 and 2016; and a voice, speech, and language supplement and children\u2019s balance supplement were included in 2012. The 2021 NHIS Taste and Smell module included questions on impairments of taste (gustation) and smell (olfaction) and on the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 NHIS Voice, Speech, and Language module is collecting data now. These supplements and modules have been coordinated and sponsored by NIDCD. Sample size: Access: These annual datasets are publicly available on the NHIS webpage. Sponsoring or supporting organizations: Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal survey that collects information on topics such as poverty, income, employment, and health insurance coverage. SIPP core content covers demographic characteristics, work experience, earnings, program participation, transfer income, and asset income. Each interview wave contains additional topical content, including one or more topical modules, allowing the Census Bureau to address a range of subjects. Relevance: Adults are asked the standard Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living battery of questions. Questions address physical and mental conditions affecting the respondent, the use of mobility aids, vision and hearing impairments, speech difficulties, lifting and aerobic difficulties, and the ability to function independently within the home. SIPP is one of the few national surveys that regularly collects data to estimate the number of people in the United States with hearing loss or deafness. This survey has shown that more than half of all persons with hearing loss or deafness are 65 years or older and less than 4% are children under 18 years of age. These findings are based on those who report difficulty hearing \u201cnormal conversation\u201d and do not include the larger population of persons affected with hearing loss outside the circumstances of normal conversation, for example, in noisy environments. Sample size: Ranging from N~14,000 to N~52,000 interviewed households (2004\u20132020). Access: These data are publicly available from the SIPP website.

See a full description of NHANES in the Hearing and Balance section of this page. Relevance: The taste and smell exam measured the ability to taste and smell, using an odor identification test and salt and quinine taste testing. The objectives of this component were the following: An in-home questionnaire about the senses of taste and smell was administered in NHANES 2011\u20132014. The taste and smell examinations were conducted beginning in 2012 for a subsample and then the full adult sample of those 40 years of age and older in NHANES, 2013\u20132014. Sample size: Adults 40+ years of age, N=3,227 (2013\u20132014). Access: These data are publicly available on the NHANES webpage. Sponsoring or supporting organization: NIDCD The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is the first population-based study of health and social factors on a national scale, aiming to understand the well-being of older, community-dwelling Americans by examining the interactions among physical health, illness, medication use, cognitive function, emotional health, sensory function, health behaviors, and social connectedness. Relevance: Among the 3,005 Wave 1 respondents, 2,928 had complete data for the key variables considered here (olfactory identification score, age, gender, and race). By design, in Wave 2, 1,944 of these respondents were randomized to receive repeat olfactory testing. Of these, 458 were deceased, too ill to participate, could not be located, or refused to be interviewed. Only 49 respondents (2.5%) refused olfactory testing, while one respondent discontinued the interview prior to the olfaction module. This yielded 1,436 respondents with olfaction data from both waves (73.9%; 694 males and 742 females; ages 57\u201385 at Wave 1). All respondents in Wave 1 and a randomly selected two-thirds of the sample in Wave 2 were asked to complete a five-item, validated odor identification test presented using felt-tipped pens (Burghart Messtechnik, Wedel, Germany). Briefly, five odorants were presented one at a time. Respondents were asked to identify each by choosing from a set of four picture/word prompts in a forced choice protocol; refusals were coded as incorrect. The target odors were rose, leather, orange, fish, and peppermint. Sample size: Older adults, N=2,928 (Wave 1).

Users can customize data maps, charts, and tables, making it easy to see information about their state or region. They can identify health differences between adults with and without disabilities overall, and by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Data can be used in presentations, reports, grant applications, or to inform decision-makers. Relevance: The DHDS is based on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) annual state-based survey (described above) and can be used to answer questions, such as: Sample size: Adults, N=418,268 (2019 BRFSS). Access: Sponsoring or supporting organizations:  Healthy People (HP) 2030 includes a wide range of objectives developed by workgroups made up of subject matter experts in specific topics. Most Healthy People objectives measure progress toward a target over time, but some aren\u2019t measurable or have other limitations. HP 2030 focuses on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for health disorders in people of all ages. Sensory or communication disorders can have a major impact on social, emotional, and physical well-being. Some groups have a higher risk, including people with low incomes, people who work in certain industries, and older adults. People who are diagnosed or treated later often have worse outcomes. Many people in the United States will have a sensory or communication disorder in their lifetime. Preventive care, like hearing screenings for newborns and hearing exams in children and adults, are critical for finding and treating these disorders early. Also, strategies to increase hearing protection can help prevent noise-induced hearing loss. Core objectives: Most Healthy People 2030 objectives are core, or measurable, objectives that have targets established for the decade. These objectives were chosen as high-priority public health issues and are associated with evidence-based interventions. Core objectives have valid, reliable, nationally representative data sources, including baseline data. Most have a measure of variability to assess statistical significance. Core objectives will be tracked for three or more time periods across the decade. Interim progress toward achieving objectives will be classified as: Relevance: A workgroup formed by NIDCD, in consultation with other interested governmental and outside subject matter experts, developed the HP core objectives for hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language, which were reviewed and approved by the Federal Interagency Workgroup (FIW). The National Eye Institute sponsored a workgroup that developed the HP objectives for vision. Mid-decade progress assessments for sensory and communication disorders are reviewed by participating U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) staff and HP Workgroup leaders in joint public webinars. Sample size: Varies depending upon the national data source used for tracking; the majority of HP objectives are tracked using the National Health Interview Survey or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
