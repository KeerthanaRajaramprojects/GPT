The goal was to discuss translational research as related to hearing and balance, identify barriers to and opportunities in translational research, and articulate activities that could be initiated by the NIDCD in order to increase the translation of scientific accomplishments from the laboratory to the research clinic and beyond to impact clinical practice and public health. Sixteen extramural scientists participated onsite and one via teleconference. All individuals had been pre-assigned to one of four discussion groups focusing on differing areas of research pertinent to translational research in hearing and balance (Molecular Diagnostic/Therapeutics, Bridging Basic Science to Clinical Science, Clinical Studies, Introduction and Emergence into Clinical Practice). Pre-meeting discussion among participants was encouraged. On the first day of the workshop, in conjunction with several invited NIH speakers, each of the 4 groups presented issues and discussion that had emerged from the pre-meeting teleconferences. On the second day, each group then presented research needs and opportunities for action. The agenda with links to presentations from both the first and second days can be found at the website above. The workshop began with an introductory presentation by Amy Donahue, Ph.D. The history, organization, definitions and scientific portfolio coding strategy used for the purpose of the workshop was provided. Dr. Donahue also provided some overview information on the NIH Roadmap. Thomas Miller, Ph.D., from the National Institute on Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS), and Bruce Cuthbert, Ph.D., National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), presented translational research programs for which they are responsible within their own NIH Institute. Jochen Schacht, Ph.D. presented a case history of translational research experiences and obstacles as related to aminoglycoside-induced HL and antioxidants. Following this introductory session, the panel on Molecular Diagnostic/Therapeutics presented their considered issues and ideas, followed by the panel on Bridging Basic Science to Clinical Science. After lunch, Katherine Woodbury Harris, Ph.D., presented information on a NIDCD preliminary clinical studies program. Presentations from the panel on Clinical Studies and the panel on Introduction and Emergence into Clinical Practice ended the first day. Each panel reconvened in the evening for additional discussion and formulation of recommendations. On the second morning, Katherine Zoon, Ph.D. National Cancer Institute presented on FDA requirements necessary to move from a newly identified molecule to human testing. Each of the four panels then presented their recommendations/suggested actions, during which there was considerable and active group discussion. Following are the abbreviated recommendations: Panel 1: Molecular Diagnostic/Therapeutics, Lauren Bakaletz, Ph.D. (Chair) Overall goal: Capitalize on the uniqueness of NIDCD (i.e. many of our disorders are preventable) to develop a model for the creation of an evidence based medicine rationale for TR. To achieve this goal: Establish stepwise developmental milestones for TR, thus providing both guidelines for, as well as a mechanism to demonstrate, forward progress/success (to be conducted in a sequential or parallel manner depending on relative state of development): epidemiological studies, development of animal models, studies of molecular mechanisms, pharmacokinetics and pathophysiology, and conduct of clinical studies. Panel 2: Bridging Basic Science to Clinical Science, Joe Miller, Ph.D. (Chair) Panel 3: Clinical Studies, Bruce Gantz, M.D. (Chair) Panel 4: Emergence into Clinical Practice, Mary Pat Moeller, Ph.D. (Chair) Following additional group discussion, the workshop adjourned at noon. \u00a0", "authors": [], "external_links": ["https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/hearing-aids",
